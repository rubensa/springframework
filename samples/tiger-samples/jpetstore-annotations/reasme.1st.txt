This is a very minimally modified version of the original Spring JPetStore, which uses the 
JDK 1.5 annotations support for transaction demarcation, instead of definitions in the XML
application context file.

The best to keep this up to date is to periodically copy over the whole original JPetStore,
and update the several files which have been added/changed.
