THE SPRING FRAMEWORK BEANDOC TOOL
---------------------------------
http://springframework.sourceforge.net/beandoc


1. INTRODUCTION

Spring BeanDoc Tool (beandoc) is a Java based tool used for documentation
and optional graphing of Spring context files (bean definition files).  The
tool reads and parses input files (XML) and generates different types of
output from them in order to help visualize dependencies between defined
services and beans for a Spring based application.  The tool can be used
programmatically, from the command line, as a maven2 report or as an ANT 
task.


2. BUILDING BEANDOC

Spring BeanDoc uses maven2 as the build system.  You will need to have this
installed in order to build from source.  From the root of the project tree,
just execute 'mvn package' (without the quotes) in order to get the
beandoc jar file.


3. RUNNING

Call the run.sh or run.bat file in the ./bin directory (you may need to 
chmod +x bin/run.sh first on proper operating systems) supplying the 
location of your beandoc.properties file.  One is included, along with
example context files, in the ./samples directory.

./bin/run.sh samples/beandoc.properties
 -or-
bin\run samples\beandoc.properties

This should leave you with the output in ./sample-output which you can
browse to in your favourite web browser.
