1. INTRODUCTION

Spring BeanDoc Tool (beandoc) is a Java based tool used for documentation
and optional graphing of Spring context files (bean definition files).  The
tool reads and parses input files (XML) and generates different types of
output from them in order to help visualize dependencies between defined
services and beans for a Spring based application.  The tool can be used
programmatically, from the command line or as an ANT task.


2. RELEASE INFO

beandoc requires J2SE 1.3, JDOM 1.0, commons-logging and spring-core.  The
"lib" directory may contain additional build dependencies that are not
required at runtime.


3. BUILDING BEANDOC

in order to build the jar file simply cd to the build directory from the
root project directory and run ANT by calling "ant dist".  Try "ant" to get
a list of other optional targets.


4. DISTRIBUTION JAR FILES

All runtime dependencies are copied to the distribution directory when the
beandoc JAR file is built and contains all files required to run the beandoc
tool programmatically or from the command line.  In order to use the ANT
task, you will obviously also need to have ANT available.
