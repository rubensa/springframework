---------
-graph.html file extension is configurable in some transformer implementations
but hardcoded into others, including hardcoded into some XSL files.  Need to
make configurable across all files/objects that need to know it.

don't link to graph files in the html docs if GraphViz is not installed or has
not been configured. *done, use 'html.includeGraphs=false' in props*

Look at specifying configurable application layers and use them to rank beans
in the graphs (problem is unlinked beans all on the same rank) *done*

possibly add a Transformer to generate a Maven report..? *done*
