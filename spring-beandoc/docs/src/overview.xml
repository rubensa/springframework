    <para>Spring BeanDoc is a tool for documenting context definition files
    used in <ulink url="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</ulink>
    projects. An unmodified beandoc run produces HTML with a JavaDoc-ish look
    and feel to it, although the tool is highly configurable and extensible to
    meet the needs of most.</para>

    <para>The tool documents a multi-file application context in a repeatable,
    fast way and is runnable from standard development tools such as IDE's,
    Ant or command shells. Re-using a standard set of properties tailored to
    your needs with different projects or context files is a trivial
    operation.</para>

    <para>BeanDoc integrates with other open source tools where appropriate.
    Significant among them is the graphing package for generating the image
    graphs, and this will need to be downloaded and installed separately on
    your machine. Fortunately this is an extremely simple operation.</para>

      <title>CVS</title>

      <para>Spring BeanDoc is part of the SpringFramework CVS repository,
      existing as a separate module from the main Spring sources. You can
      <ulink
      url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/springframework/spring-beandoc/">view
      the module</ulink> via ViewCVS or <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=73357">check it out
      anonymously</ulink> using normal CVS access. The module name is
      <emphasis role="bold">spring-beandoc</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>Releases</title>

      <para>If you don't wish to track CVS you can <ulink url="???">download
      release files</ulink> which contain all of the project sources, samples
      and compiled documentation instead.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Building the sources</title>

      <para>Having checked out or unzipped the project sources, cd to the
      <literal>build</literal> directory and invoke <literal>ant
      dist</literal> to generate the <literal>spring-beandoc.jar</literal>
      file. This file, along with all other runtime dependencies will be
      placed in <literal>target/dist</literal> (unless you overrode the target
      directory in your <literal>build.properties</literal>). Runtime libs can
      now be added to any of your Spring projects that you wish to document,
      or just left where they are and referenced on the classpath.</para>

    <title>GraphViz</title>

    <para>One of the most useful features of BeanDoc is its ability to
    generate configurable graphs of the context files. The actual graphing
    tool used is called GraphViz, and you will need to obtain and install a
    copy for your platform from <ulink url="http://www.graphviz.org">their
    website</ulink>. Thanks to the ATT guys for a great tool.</para>
