We're using the DocBook XSL distribution for HTML and PDF
generation. The best results can be achieved with the
Saxon XSLT processor (don't use Xalan!) and the Apache
FOP library.

The documentation is generated by SpringBeanDoc's build.xml file
for Ant. Targets included are:

* docpdf        - generates the PDF documentation
* dochtml       - generates the HTML documentation
* dochtmlsingle - generates single page HTML documentation
* docclean      - clean any output directories for docs

To generate documentation, you need to include a lot
of libraries, which haven't been added to CVS because
they're simply too big. The libraries can be found at:
http://www.jteam.nl/spring/reference-libraries.zip.
Download them, create a docs/DocBook/lib directory in the
and unzip the libraries there, then the targets should work.

Thanks to Hibernate, for providing the skeleton for
DocBook documentation!
