THE SPRING FRAMEWORK BEANDOC TOOL
---------------------------------


In order to get cracking straight away with some sample output you will need
to ensure that you have built the beandoc jar first.  If you haven't yet done
so, switch to the project root directory and run 'ant dist'.  Then come back
here.

Without modification, the sample output will be a transformation of the 
context files in the ./jpetstore/ directory.  Execute either of the 
'runbeandox-XXX' files for your platform (remember to chmod +x the .sh files
first).  Output will be placed in the ../target/beandoc/ directory assuming
a successful run.

More information on configuring, running and extending BeanDoc is in the 
reference documentation.
