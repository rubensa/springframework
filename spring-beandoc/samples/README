THE SPRING FRAMEWORK BEANDOC TOOL
---------------------------------

In order to get cracking straight away with some sample output you will need
to ensure that you have built the beandoc jar first.  If you haven't yet done
so, switch to the project root directory and run 'ant dist'.  Then come back
here.

Without modification, the sample output will be a transformation of the 
context files in the ./jpetstore/ directory.

To test the command line interface to beandoc, execute either of the 
'runbeandox-cli' files for your platform (remember to chmod +x the .sh file
first).  Output will be placed in the ../target/sample-output/ directory 
assuming a successful run.

To test the Ant task, simply execute 'ant' from here.  Have a look through 
the build.xml file in this directory for more options when using Ant.

More information on configuring, running and extending BeanDoc is in the 
reference documentation.
