<P>The output package holds classes used to actually generate
beandoc documentation (usually HTML) and where appropriate, .dot files
that the graphing engine will use to draw the graphs. A default XSLT
implementation is included, but power users may wish to define their own
implementation using different stylesheets or even different transform
technologies (such as FreeMarker) for absolute control over all aspects
of the output.</P>
