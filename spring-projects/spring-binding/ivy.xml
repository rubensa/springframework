  <!-- 
       Some standard dependency configurations, known to the build system.
       What configuration a dependency is declared in has implications as to whether
       it's available in the compile classpath and the test classpath, and whether it
       is expected to be bundled with the final artifact (or only needed for compiles,
       as the container will make it available).
  -->
  <configurations>
  
    <!-- 
       default: the default externally visible configuration. Other modules will
       depend on this config or any other externally visible configs you may 
       optionally define. Normally you shouldn't add dependencies to this config,
       unless they are strictly runtime-only, and don't need to be touched at all
       by the build system.-->
    <conf name="default" extends="global"/>

    <!-- global: dependencies needed at compile-time, test-time, and runtime (the
	     latter implies bundling for runtime, i.e. the container doesn't include them -->
