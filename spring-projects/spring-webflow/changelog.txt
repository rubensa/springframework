SPRING WEB FLOW CHANGELOG
=========================
http://www.springframework.org

Changes in version 1.0 Early Access (02.3.2006)
------------------------------------

Overall
* The proposal to the community for Spring Web Flow 1.0; the next release will be 1.0 RC1 
  after a fixed user evaluation period
* Introduced the reference manual in HTML and PDF form, see "docs" directory.
* Added unit tests, with total test coverage above 70%.
* Added extensive JavaDoc enhancements.

Package org.springframework.webflow
* Added support for custom start, signal event, end, and handleException behavior to the Flow class.
* Added state exception handling support at the State level.  States may now be configured with a set of
  one or more StateExceptionHandler objects for responding to exceptions that occur within the state of a flow execution.
* Added state exception handling support at the Flow level.  Flows may now be configured with a set of
  one or more StateExeceptionHandler objects, for responding to exceptions that occur within a state but are not handled by that state.
* Added support for "global transitions" at the Flow level.  Flows may now be configured with a set 
  of one or more Transition objects that are inherited by all states of the Flow.
* Added Transition TargetStateResolver strategy, allowing for dynamic target state calculation.
* Added the ExternalContext facade for providing a normalized interface about external clients who have called into
  the Spring Web Flow system.
* Added ParameterMap and AttributeMap map decorators, for strongly-typed Map access support.
* Renamed ViewDescriptor and ViewDescriptorCreator to ViewSelection and ViewSelector, respectively, for clarity and consistency with lexicon.
  Also made ViewSelection immutable, as a value object created by a selector.
* Introduced a ViewSelection hierarchy for each of the supported response types: ApplicationView (forward), 
  ConversationRedirect, FlowRedirect, ExternalRedirect, and NullView, respectively.
* Renamed AnnotatedObject properties and Event parameters to "attributes", respectively, for consistency.

Package org.springframework.webflow.action
* Added support for invoking strongly typed methods on arbitrary beans (POJOs) as a SWF Action.
  SWF is now capable of invoking an abitrary java.lang.Object method
  like 'search(SearchCriteria critera)', when using a "bean invoking action" as an
  alternative to implementing the 'execute(RequestContext context)'  Action interface or
  extending MultiAction.  SWF is also capable of exposing return values on those bean methods
  in request or flow scope, as well as responding to method exceptions.
  See the Phonebook sample app for an example.
* Added BeanFactoryBeanInvokingAction, an action that can invoke any instance method on any bean managed by the Spring bean factory.
* Added LocalBeanInvokingAction, an action that can invoke any instance method on any bean.
* Added "CompositeEvent" support for composite actions that may generate multiple action result events.
* Added "validateUsingValidatorMethod" property to FormAction, useful for supporting piecemeal validation as part of a wizard flow.
* Added ActionUtils utility class, useful when implementing actions.
* Added a convenience constructor to the Event class that takes a single parameter name/value. Mainly for use in unit tests.
* Added a convenience constructor to the FormAction class that takes the formObjectClass name.
* Added logic in FormAction to automatically calculate a camelcase formObjectName from the formObjectClass if the name is not set.
* Added StatefulActionProxy, an action that delegates to a stateful action managed in flow scope.
* Added convenience methods for retrieving action execution properties to the AbstractAction class.
* Improved "validatorMethod" handling in FormAction: if no formObjectClass is specified, the invoked validator method
  should have a signature matching "public void ${validatorMethod}(Object obj, Errors errors)". When you do specify a
  formObjectClass, everything works like before, e.g. the signature will be
  "public void ${validatorMethod}(${formObjectClass} obj, Errors errors)".
* Removed DelegatingAction in favor of StatefulActionProxy and bean invoking actions.

Package org.springframework.webflow.builder
* Added support for "global-transitions", transitions attached at the flow level and inherited by all states.
* Added support for "inline-flows", local flow definitions fully nested within another flow definition.
* Added support for locally flow scoped artifacts, importable as bean definitions using the "import" element.
* Added support for action "resultName" and "resultScope" properties, for exposing POJO method return values
  as attributes in a flow execution scope automatically.  See 'action' element in XML DTD.
* Added support for automatic creation of flow variables during flow startup, see 'var' element in XML DTD.
* Added "redirect" attribute to view-state for requesting conversational redirects that permit browser refresh.
* Added support for mapping subflow output attributes into parent flow collections.  See 'output' element in XML DTD.
* Added AbstractFlowBuilder addDecisionState(...) methods for completeness.
* Introduced the FlowArtifactFactory, for accessing externally managed flow artifacts during the flow building process.
* Changed AbstractFlowBuilder addSubflowState(...) methods to return the added SubflowState, consistent with other add methods.
* Reworked FlowBuilder, externalizing flow id assignment from the builder itself (assignment is now a responsibility of the director).
* Renamed the "config" package to "builder" for clarity.
* Removed flow artifact creation and autowiring support in favor of artifact lookup by id (which is more compelling now with flow-definition scoped artifact support).

Package org.springframework.webflow.context
* Introduced webflow.context package for housing common ExternalContext implementations.
* Introduced ExternalContext implementations for HTTP Servlet and JSR 168 Portlet environments.
  This adds support for accessing request, session, and application variables from within SWF 
  in a consistent manner (regardless of the environment in which SWF is called).

Package org.springframework.webflow.execution
* Added paused, resumed, and sessionEnding FlowExecutionListener callbacks.
* Added UidGenerator strategy, providing a plugin point for generating unique keys.
* Introduced FlowExecutionRepository subsystem, for tracking ongoing conversations between browsers and 
  the Spring Web Flow system.  This subsystem obsoletes both the FlowExecutionStorage and TransactionSynchronizer
  infrastructure, as it provides the capabilities of both in a single system.
* Added support for continuation-based repositories (aka 'continuation servers'),
  including a built-in capability to limit the max number of continuations allowed per conversation
  as well as automatically invalidate all continuations associated with a conversation that has ended
  ("conversation invalidation after completion").  Explicit support for conversation and continuation
  expiry, as well as metadata-driven continuation invalidation strategies is under consideration.
* Added support for tracking and accessing the "current view selection" of a conversation accessible under 
  a bookmarkable conversation URL.
* Added for conversation locking, allowing exclusive access to a conversation contended for my multiple 
  concurrent threads.
* Reworked the flow execution package, decoupling the Event abstraction from the notion of an ExternalContext.
* Reworked the FlowExecution interface, making central start and signalEvent operations more explicit.  It is also now 
  impossible for external actors to signal an event in another state other than the current state.
  Also removed the "rehydrate" method from the public interface, as it's an implementation detail to 
  internal actors that create and restore flow executions.
* Removed FlowExecutionStorage infrastructure, replaced by an enhanced FlowExecutionRepository subsystem.
* Removed TransactionSynchronizer abstraction, which has been obsoleted since such a capability is being built
  into the FlowExecutionRepository implementations directly.
* Removed support for invoking flows in arbitrary states other than the current state for security reasons.
  Support for a single, externally referenceable navigation state per flow is under consideration.
* Removed ExpiredFlowCleanupFilter, as a more powerful expiry capability built into the
  FlowExecutionRepository subsystem is under consideration.

Package org.springframework.webflow.executor
* Introduced the webflow.executor package, the highest-layer subsystem of SWF for driving the execution of flows.
* Renamed FlowExecutionManager to FlowExecutor; FlowExecutor is now a central facade interface
  defining the SWF system boundary for typical clients.  FlowExecutorImpl is the default implementation; FlowLocator is now a required dependency.
* Added ResponseInstruction, for allowing strongly-typed access to a flow execution context when preparing 
  a response to issue.
* Added the FlowExecutorArgumentExtractor helper for extracting arguments needed by FlowExecutor implementations
  such as the flowId, flowExecutionKey, and eventId.
* Renamed all instances of "flowExecutionId" with "flowExecutionKey", for consistency with the FlowExecutionKey class.
  Note: this change affects the views of existing SWF applications, requiring a rename of the 
  _flowExcutionId input parameter to _flowExcutionKey.
* Added RequestPathFlowExecutorParameterExtractor, for extracting parameters from the request URL. 
  This faciliates flows being launched in REST-style, for example http://localhost/springair/reservations/booking.
* Introduced JSF flow executor integration, see the "jsf" package.
* Reinstated the Spring Portlet MVC flow executor integration, see the "mvc" package and "phonebook-portlet" sample.
  Note: the portlet MVC support requires Spring 2.0.
  
Package org.springframework.webflow.registry
* Added the FlowRegistry subsystem in webflow.registry, for registering groups of refreshable Flow definitions.
  With this addition, XML flow definitions may now be refreshed from their registries at runtime by using a
  JMX client like Sun's jConsole that ships standard with JDK 1.5.
* Added a refreshable FlowRegistryImpl, for managing a reloadable registry of flow definitions, 
  typically populated by an XmlFlowRegistrar or custom FlowRegistrar.  See XmlFlowRegistryFactoryBean
  as a convenient mechanism for populating a FlowRegistry using a standard Spring bean definition.
* Added RefreshableFlowHolder, capable of automatically detecting changes on externalized flow 
  definitions and refreshing those definitions without requiring a container restart.
  
Package org.springframework.webflow.test
* Improved FlowExecution test support with AbstractFlowExecutionTests.
* Decoupled flow execution test infrastructure from a first class dependency on spring-mock and
  AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests; this allows for testing flow executions and 
  their associated artifacts in isolation without a dependency on the container, and also makes it
  easier to test a flow execution with a mock service-layer.  See Phonebook and Sellitem src/test 
  tree for an example.
* Added convenient AbstractXmlFlowExecutionTests, for easy testing of xml-based flow definitions.
* Small improvements in MockRequestContext to make it easier to use.

Package org.springframework.webflow.samples
* Changed numberguess sample application to use the new StatefulActionProxy.
* Added sellitem-jsf sample.
* Added phonebook-portlet sample.
* Added shippingrate sample, showing Spring Web Flow together with Ajax technology.

Changes in version PR5 (28.7.2005)
------------------------------------
* Renamed the static helpers in the ServletEvent class to match with their instance counterparts: e.g. getHttpServletRequest()
  was renamed to getRequest().
* Renamed the addSubFlowState(...) methods in AbstractFlowBuilder to addSubflowState(...) to be consistent with the class name.
* Reorganized packages to remove all cyclic dependencies. Most of the changes were in packages not typically used by end users
  of the system. As a result the impact on existing applications should be limited. Changes to look out for are:
  FlowConversionService is now in package org.springframework.webflow.convert, ExpiredFlowCleanupFilter is now in package
  org.springframework.webflow.execution.servlet and FlowExecutionListenerAdapter moved to the package
  org.springframework.webflow.execution.
* Fixed JDK 1.3 compatability issues.
* Fixed several bugs reported in JIRA.
* Several improvements in FlowAction (the SWF-Struts integration).
* Fixed Struts 1.1 compatability issues.
* Minor changes in the SWF DTD: the "property" element is now always the first sub element of its containing parent element.
* Added several unit tests, e.g. for FormAction.
* Drastically improved FormAction. This also involved some minor refactorings in the FormObjectAccessor.
* Improved AttributeMapperAction.
* Improved JavaDoc.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup, especially in spring-binding.

Changes in version PR4 (17.7.2005)
------------------------------------
* Top level package rename from org.springframework.web.flow to org.springframework.webflow.
* Changes to make this SWF compatible with Spring 1.2.2 and later.
* Moved to a new build system based on Ant and Ivy.
* Temporarily dropped Portlet support untill it is included in Spring 1.3.
* Added state entry and exit actions.
* Added some additional callbacks to the FlowExecutionListener: loaded(), saved() and removed().
* Greatly enhanced expression language support.
* Enhanced attribute mapper type conversion support.
* Added SessionTransactionSynchronizer.
* Added several convenience actions: CompositeAction, DelegatingAction and GuardedAction.
* Introduced basic JMX monitoring capabilities, to be improved in future releases.
* Better and simpler Struts integration. Check the "BirthDate" sample for an example.
* Refactored FormObjectAccessor so that the getters return null instead of throwing an exception when the form object or Errors
  instance cannot be found.
* Refactored FlowExecutionListenerList to no longer depend on the closure support in the sandbox. As a result, the
  iteratorTemplate() method was removed.
* Fixed NullPointerException in Flow.getTransitionableState(String).
* The FlowExecutionManager now allows you to register FlowExecutionListener s for executions of particular flows. This makes it
  easy to have a single manager managing all the flow executions in your app and still have listeners that apply to just a
  specific flow. To make this possible, the FlowExecutionListenerCriteria were introduced.
* The TransitionableState now has a reenter() method that will be called when the state is re-entered. This allows you to have
  different behaviour when the state is first entered, or re-entered.
* Fixed problem with 'form states': view states that use a setup action and a bindAndValidate when transitioning out of the state.
  The validation errors generated by the bindAndValidate were being overwritten by the setupForm action when the view state
  re-entered.
* Removed hardwired dependency on LinkedHashSet, for use with JDK 1.3.
* The ongoing flow execution is now exposed to the view as a FlowExecutionContext instance with name flowExecutionContext in the
  model. Existing apps should change the use of flowExecution in their views to flowExecutionContext from now on.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and JavaDoc enhancements.

Changes in version PR3 (22.5.2005)
------------------------------------
* Renamed EventParameterMapperAction to AttributeMapperAction.
* Dynamic (pluggable) view selection and model population capability for view states.
* View state setup actions.
* View forward and redirect expressions.
* Subflow attribute mapping expressions.
* Support for primitive/complex property types (besides string) using new type conversion infrastructure.
* Enhanced flow execution listener lifecycle methods resumed, paused.
* Pluggable expression evaluation capability.
* Pluggability for all core definition objects: Flow, State, Transition, action, ...
* Pluggability of transaction synchronizer interface for custom application-transaction demarcation.
* A lot of general refining and polishing – package structure should be stable now.
* Flow attribute mapping is now possible from a XML definition using the new "input", and "output" mapping elements within the
  "attribute-mapper" element (see the spring-webflow.dtd).
* FlowController now provides a setFlow(Flow) method for convenience.
* Renamed XmlFlowBuilder.resource to "location" for consistency.
* Introduced convenient XmlFlowFactoryBean.
* Introduced flow properties.
* Introduced state properties.
* Introduced transition properties.
* The last transition to execute is now available for access via the RequestContext, allowing states and/or actions to reason on
  transition properties.
* Renamed AbstractAction.doExecuteAction to AbstractAction.doExecute for consistency and conciseness.
* Fixed bug where an incoming transaction token was searched for in the last event on the request context. The search now always
  uses the originating event of the request context.
* Added support for transition actions. These actions can also be used as transition execution criteria.
* Made Struts FlowExecutionStorage strategy pluggable.
* Refactored ActionStateAction into AnnotatedAction. This has several advantages: it completely decouples Action from ActionState
  and avoids error prone lookup of action properties by the action itself.
* Fixed bug in ExternalEvent.searchForParameter().
* Simplified sample app package structure, collapsing unnecessary packages.
* Added some extra mapping configuration methods to ParameterizableFlowAttributeMapper.
* Added some convenience constructors to EventParameterMapperAction.
* Fixed bug in Struts integration where Errors instance was not exposed via BindingActionForm adapter correctly.
* Birthdate sample now is fully Struts-based, using Struts html form taglibs in the JSPs.
* Added StrutsEvent, for easy access to a Struts ActionForm and ActionMapping from Web Flow action code.
* Added Flow Launcher sample application illustrating different ways of launching flows with input parameters.
* Fixed bug where flowExecution.start(event) was mapping all starting event parameters into flow scope.
* Added getFormObject() and getFormErrors() methods that search both request and flow scope to FormObjectAccessor class.
* Reworked FormObjectAccessor to alias form object and error instances under well-defined names.
* Added getOrCreateAttribute method to Scope class.
* Added assertAttributePresent method to Scope class.
* Added Number Guess sample application, with two number guess games demonstrating flow-scoped history.
* The FormAction now uses the WebDataBinder (introduced in Spring 1.2 RC2) to properly support HTML checkboxes.
* Fixed bug in FlowController and PortletFlowController where the flowLocator property of the default flow execution manager was
  not getting initialized.
* Improved build scripts for sample applications.
* Fixed bug in PortletFlowController. As a result it now requires a Portlet session, which it will create if none exists.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and JavaDoc enhancements.

Changes in version PR2 (11.4.2005)
------------------------------------
* Added sample flow execution tests to PhoneBook sample app.
* ViewDescriptor is now an AttributeSource.
* Added Sell Item sample application, demonstrating a wizard using continuations to preserve use of back/refresh browser buttons.
  This sample application also demonstrates the use of OGNL based transitional criteria.
* Introduced TransitionCriteriaCreator, used by a FlowBuilder to create a transition criteria object based on an encoded string
  representation. Two TransitionCriteriaCreator implementations are provided out-of-the-box:
	* SimpleTransitionCriteriaCreator, the default, that does exact eventId matching or "*" wildcard matching (like in SWF
	  preview 1).
	* OgnlTransitionCriteriaCreator, that parses an OGNL expression expressing a condition to be evaluated in the request context
	  (e.g. ${lastEvent.id=='success' and flowScope.sale.shipping}).
* Improved Phonebook sample deployment configuration, for easily reusing configuration between test and production environments.
* Introduced MockFlowExecutionListener to support writing unit tests.
* Added Portlet support. This also led to some minor refactoring, e.g. the abstract class ExternalEvent was introduced.
* Improved package dependencies in sandbox classes shipped in webflow-support.jar - mainly package moves from 'util' to 'core'.
* Reimplemented MultiAction using new utility class: DispatchMethodInvoker.
* Added containsProperty() method to ActionStateAction.
* Birthdate sample now demonstrates Spring Web Flow Struts integration.
* Added some convenience methods to AbstractAction: getProperty(), containsProperty(), getActionStateAction() and getActionState().
* The FlowController no longer requires a pre-existing HTTP session by forcing the "requiresSession" property to true. HTTP
  session access is now done via the HttpSessionFlowExecutionStorage, which provides a "createSession" property (which defaults to
  true, instructing the creation of a new session if no existing session is found). If you're not using an HTTP session backed
  flow execution storage, there is of course no need for an HTTP session at all.
* Introduced convenience XML attribute for action-state: method="foo"
* Renamed the ActionStateAction executeMethodName property to just method for simplicity.
* Renamed FormAction.bindOnNewForm to bindOnSetupForm for consistency. Also renamed FormAction.suppressValidation to
  FormAction.validationEnabled to use positive logic.
* Added FormAction.validate(RequestContext, Object, Errors) hook for easy customization of validation logic.
* Added an ActionStateAction validatorMethod property, to specify a specific validation method to be invoked on the configured
  Validator used by the FormAction. This allows piecemeal validation to support wizard pages, for example. The validation method
  must be of the form public void <method>(Object formObject, Errors errors).
* Reworked flow execution management (via FlowExecutionManager) and introduced pluggable flow execution storage strategies (via
  FlowExecutionStorage). This introduces many exciting features and possibilities:
	* Integration with Portlets and other frameworks is very trivial now, no need to implement a custom manager.
* You now have the option to store flow execution state in any backing data store, e.g. the HttpSession (the default), a database,
  serialized files, ...
	* You may now store execution state client side if you want - no HTTP session required.
	* You can select to use a continuations based storage strategy, basically turning Spring Web Flow into a continuation driven
	  system. On top of that, you can choose between client side or server side continuation storage. The continuation storage
	  strategies also support GZIP compression.
* Renamed TransitionableState.getRequiredTransition() to TransitionableState.transitionFor().
* Removed TransitionableState.executeTransition() in favor of TransitionableState.transitionFor(context).execute(context).
* Removed hardwired dependency on LinkedHashSet, for use with JDK 1.3.
* Added dispose() method to FlowBuilder to release any resources held by the builder.
* Removed unused methods from AbstractFlowBuilder: attributeMapperId() and eventId().
* Default "cacheSeconds" for FlowController is now 0 (no caching).
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and JavaDoc enhancements.

Changes in version PR1 (30.3.2005)
------------------------------------
* First public preview release.
