			Once a flow has been defined any number of executions of it can be launched in parallel 
			at runtime.  Execution of a flow is carried out by a dedicated system that 
			is based internally on a state machine that runs atop the Java VM.  As the the life of an
			flow execution can span more than one request into the server, this system 
			is also responsible for persisting conversational state across requests.
		</para>
		<para>
			This chapter documents Spring Web Flow's flow execution system.  You'll
			learn the core constructs of the system and how to execute flows out-of-container 
			within a JUnit test environment.

    	<title>FlowExecution</title>
    	<para>
		    An executing flow is called a <emphasis>flow execution</emphasis>, realized by 
		    an instance of <literal>org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecution</literal>.
		    A flow execution represents the state of a conversation at a point in time.
		    Given an instance  of <literal>org.springframework.webflow.Flow</literal>, any
		    number of flow executions can be created.  A flow definition serves as the
		    instructional blueprint for a flow execution.  
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>
				It may be helpful to think of a flow as analagous to <literal>Class</literal> and a 
				flow execution as analagous to an instance of that <literal>Class</literal>
			</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once created, a new flow execution is initially inactive, waiting to be started.  Once 
			started, a flow execution enters its <literal>startState</literal> and continues executing until 
			it enters a <literal>ViewState</literal> where user input is required to continue or
			it enters an <literal>EndState</literal> where it terminates.
		</para>
		<para>
			When a flow execution reaches a <literal>ViewState</literal> it is said to have <emphasis>paused</emphasis>,
			where it waits in that state for user input to be provided so it can continue.  After pausing the 
			<literal>ViewSelection</literal> returned is typically used to issue a response to the user
			that provides a vehicle for collecting the required input.
		</para>
		<para>			
			User input is provided by <emphasis>signaling an event</emphasis> that
			<emphasis>resumes</emphasis> the flow execution by communicating what user action was taken.
			Parameters sent in the signal event request form the basis for user input.  The flow execution 
			responds to an event in standard fashion by executing a matching state transition
			in the resuming <literal>ViewState</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once a flow execution has resumed after being paused by a view state, it continues executing 
			until it again enters another view state or enters an end state where it terminates.  Once 
			a flow execution has terminated it cannot be resumed.
		</para>
	    <sect2 id="execution-lifecycle">
 	  	 	<title>Flow execution lifecycle</title>
   	 		<para>
    			As outlined, a flow execution can go through a number of phases throughout its lifecycle; 
   		 		for example, <emphasis>created</emphasis>, <emphasis>active</emphasis>, <emphasis>paused</emphasis>, 
   		 		<emphasis>ended</emphasis>.
   		 	</para>
    		<para>
   	 			Spring Web Flow gives you full control over the ability to observe the lifecycle of an

			As you can see, the <literal>activeSession</literal> of a flow execution changes when a subflow 
			is spawned.  Each flow execution maintains a stack of flow sessions, where each flow session 
			represents a spawned instance of a flow definition.  When a flow execution starts, the session stack initially 
			consists of one (1) entry, an instance dubbed the <emphasis>root session</emphasis>.
			When a subflow is spawned, the stack increases to two (2) entries.  When the subflow ends, 
			the stack decreases back to one (1) entry.  The active session is always
			the session at the top of the stack.
