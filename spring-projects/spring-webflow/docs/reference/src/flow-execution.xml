			Spring Web Flow allows developers to build reusable, self-contained controller modules
			called flows.  A flow is a blueprint for a user conversation (or dialog)
			that drives the execution of application code to complete a business goal.
		</para>
		<para>
			Flows are defined declaratively using a rich domain-specific language (DSL) 
			tailored to the problem domain of page flow.  Currently, Java-based and XML-based
			forms of this language are provided.
		</para>
		<para>
			This chapter documents Spring Web Flow's flow execution system.  You'll
			learn the core constructs of the system and how to execute flows within a variety 
			of environments.
