			Once a flow has been defined any number of executions of it can be launched in parallel 
			at runtime.  Execution of a flow is carried out by a dedicated system that 
			is based internally on a state machine that runs atop the Java VM.  As the the life of an
			flow execution can span more than one request into the server, this system 
			is also responsible for persisting conversational state across requests.

			This chapter documents Spring Web Flow's flow execution system.  You'll
			learn the core constructs of the system and how to execute flows within a variety 
			of environments, including JUnit, Spring MVC, Struts, and Java Server Faces (JSF).
