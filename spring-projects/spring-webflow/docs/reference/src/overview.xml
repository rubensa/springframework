			Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a core module of the Spring
			Framework focused on the definition and orchestration of
			page flow within a web application.
		</para>
		<para>
			The system allows you to capture logical page flows as
			self-contained modules that are reusable in different
			situations. The system is ideal for building web application
			modules that guide the user through controlled navigations
			that drive business processes. These processes typically
			span HTTP requests and may be dynamic in nature.
		</para>
		<para>
			SWF exists at a higher-level of abstraction, building on
			existing frameworks like Struts, Spring MVC, and JSF,
			capturing your application's page flow explicity in a
			declarative fashion. SWF is a very a powerful framework
			based on a finite-state machine for the definition and
			execution of a web conversation.
