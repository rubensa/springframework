1. INTRODUCTION

Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a product of the Spring community focused on the definition
and execution of page flow within a web application.

The system allows you to capture logical page flows as self-contained modules that are
reusable in different situations. The system is ideal for web applications that guide
the user through controlled navigations that drive business processes.  These processes
typically span HTTP requests and may be dynamic in nature.

SWF is a focused page flow engine that integrates with existing frameworks like Spring MVC,
Struts, and JSF, capable of capturing your application's page flow explicity in a
declarative, reusable fashion.  SWF is a very a powerful framework based on a finite-state
machine for the definition and execution of web conversations.
