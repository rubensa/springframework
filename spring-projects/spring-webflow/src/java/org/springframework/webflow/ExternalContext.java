 * A facade that provides access to the state of an external system that has
 * interacted with Spring Web Flow.

 * This context object provides a single, consistent interface for internal SWF
 * artifacts to use to reason on and manipulate the state of an external actor
 * calling into SWF to execute flows. It represents the context about a single,
 * <i>external</i> request to manipulate a flow execution.
 * <p>
 * The design of this interface was inspired by JSF's own ExternalContext
 * abstraction, and thus shares the same name for consistency. If a particular
 * external client type does not support all methods defined by this interface,
 * they can just be implemented as returning an empty map.
