/**
 * A service interface that maps attributes between two flows.
 * <p>
 * An attribute mapper may map attributes of a parent flow down to a child flow
 * as <i>input</i> when the child is spawned as a subflow. In addition, a
 * mapper may map attributes of a child flow scope back up to a resuming parent
 * flow, as <i>output</i> when the child session ends and control is returned
 * to the parent flow.
 * <p>
 * For example, say you have the following parent flow session:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      Parent Flow Session 1
 *      ---------------------
 *      - flow=myFlow
 *      - flowScope=[map:attr1=value1, attr2=value2, attr3=value3]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For "Parent Flow Session 1" above, there are 3 attributes in flow scope
 * ("attr1", "attr2", and "attr3", respectively.) Any of these three attributes
 * may be mapped as input down to child subflows when those subflows are
 * spawned. An implementation of this interface performs the actual mapping,
 * encapsulating knowledge of <i>which</i> attributes should be mapped, and
 * <i>how</i> they will be mapped (for example, will the same attribute names
 * be used between flows or not?).
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      Flow Attribute Mapper
 *      ---------------------
 *      - inputMappings=(map:attr1-&gt;attr1, attr3-&gt;localAttr1)
 *      - outputMappings=(map:localAttr1-&gt;attr3)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The above example "Flow Attribute Mapper" specifies
 * <code>inputMappings</code> that define which parent attributes to map as
 * input to the child. In this case, two attributes in the parent are mapped,
 * "attr1" and "attr3". "attr1" is mapped with the name "attr1" (given the same
 * name in both flows), while "attr3" is mapped to "localAttr1", given a
 * different name that is local to the child flow.
 * <p>
 * Likewise, when a child flow ends, the <code>outputMappings</code> define
 * which attributes to map as output up to the parent. In this case the
 * attribute "localAttr1" will be mapped up to the parent as "attr3", updating
 * the value of "attr3" in the parent's flow scope.
 * <p>
 * Note: because FlowAttributeMappers are singletons, take care not to store
 * and/or modify caller-specific state in a unsafe manner. The FlowAttributeMapper
 * methods run in an independently executing thread on each invocation, so make
 * sure you deal only with local data or internal, thread-safe services.
