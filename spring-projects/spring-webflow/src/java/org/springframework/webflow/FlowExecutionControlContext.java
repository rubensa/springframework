/**
 * Mutable control interface used to manipulate an ongoing flow execution in the
 * context of one client request. Primarily used internally by the various flow
 * artifacts when they are invoked, but also used by the flow execution
 * management layer to drive flow execution.
 * <p>
 * This interface acts as a facade for core definition constructs such as the
 * central <code>Flow</code> and <code>State</code> classes, abstracting
 * away details about the runtime <i>execution</i> subsystem defined in the
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution} package.
 * <p>
 * Note this type is not the same as the {@link FlowExecutionContext}! Objects
 * of this type are <i>request specific</i>: they provide a control interface
 * for manipulating exactly one flow execution locally from exactly one request.
 * A <code>FlowExecutionContext</code> provides information about a single
 * flow execution (conversation), and it's scope is not local to a specific
 * request (or thread).
