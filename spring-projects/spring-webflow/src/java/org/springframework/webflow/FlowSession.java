/**
 * A runtime object that represents a single client session of a
 * specific <code>Flow</code> definition. This object maintains all the 
 * state of the session, including its status within exactly one
 * governing FlowExecution and its current State. This object also acts
 * as the "flow scope" data model. Data in "flow scope" lives for the life
 * of this object, and is cleaned up automatically when this object is
 * destroyed. Destruction happens when this session enters an end state.
 * <p>
 * This object is fully managed by a FlowExecution within a stack-based 
 * data structure, where each session in the stack is a spawned 
 * flow at a specific state. The session at the top of the
 * stack is the currently active flow. This stack of all flow sessions captures the
 * complete and current state (snapshot) of an executing flow.
 * <p>
 * A flow session will go through several status changes during its lifecycle.
 * Initially it will be {@link FlowSessionStatus#CREATED}. For example, when 
 * a new FlowExecution is started to launch a new root Flow definition a new
 * FlowSession is created.
 * <p>
 * When a flow session is activated (about to be manipulated), it's status becomes
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#ACTIVE}. In the case of a new FlowExecution, 
 * session activation happens immediately after creation to put the "root flow" at
 * the top of the stack and transition it to its start state.
 * <p>
 * When control returns to the client for user think time, the status is updated
 * to {@link FlowSessionStatus#PAUSED}. The flow is no longer actively 
 * processing: it's stored off somewhere waiting on the user to participate.
 * <p>
 * If a flow session is pushed down in the stack because a subflow is spawned, its 
 * status becomes {@link FlowSessionStatus#SUSPENDED} until the subflow returns (ends) 
 * and is popped off the stack. The resuming flow session then becomes active once
 * again.
 * <p>
 * When a flow session is terminated because an EndState is reached, its status
 * becomes {@link FlowSessionStatus#ENDED}, ending its lifecycle. The session is 
 * popped off the stack and discarded, and any allocated resources in "flow scope" are
 * automatically cleaned up.
 * <p>
 * Note that a flow <i>session</i> is in no way linked to an HTTP session! It
 * just uses the familiar "session" naming convention to denote a stateful 
 * interaction.
