/**
 * An instance of a single executing <code>Flow</code> participating in a
 * flow execution. Also acts as a "flow-scope" data model.
 * <p>
 * The stack of executing flow sessions represents the complete state of an
 * ongoing flow execution.
 * <p>
 * A flow session will go through several states during its lifecycle.
 * Initially it will be {@link FlowSessionStatus#CREATED}. Once the flow
 * session is activated in a flow execution, it becomes
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#ACTIVE}. When control returns to the client for
 * user think time, the status becomes {@link FlowSessionStatus#PAUSED}.
 * If the flow session is deactivated because a subflow was spawned, it will become
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#SUSPENDED} until the subflow returns (ends).
 * When the flow session is terminated by the flow execution, its status becomes
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#ENDED}, ending its lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * Note that a flow <i>session</i> is in no way linked to an HTTP session! It
 * just uses the familiar "request/session" naming convention.
