/**
 * Central interface that allows clients to access contextual information about
 * an ongoing flow execution within the context of a client request. The term
 * <i>request</i> is used to symbolize a call into the flow system to
 * manipulate an executing flow.
 * <p>
 * A new request context is created when one of the entry points on the
 * <code>FlowExecution</code> facade interface is invoked, either
 * ({@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecution#start(Event)}
 * to activate a new executing flow, or
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecution#signalEvent(Event)}) to
 * manipulate the state of an already executing flow.
 * <p>
 * Once created, this context interface is passed around throughout request
 * processing, where it may be referenced and reasoned upon, typically by
 * user-implemented action code and state transition criteria. The request
 * context is disposed when an entry-point call into a flow execution returns.
 * This fact means the request context is an internal artifact used within the
 * flow system -- the context object will not be exposed to external client code.
 * <p>
 * Note that a <i>request</i> context is in no way linked to an HTTP request!
 * It just uses the familiar "request" naming convention.
