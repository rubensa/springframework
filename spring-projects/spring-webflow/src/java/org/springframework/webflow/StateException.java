/**
 * Core base class for exceptions that occur in a flow state. Provides a

 * <p>
 * State exceptions occur at runtime, when the flow is executing requests
 * on behalf of a client. They signal that an execution problem occured: e.g.
 * action execution failed or no transition was would matching a particular
 * request context. A state exception does not indicate a flow definition
 * problem, a FlowArtifactLookupException is used for that.
