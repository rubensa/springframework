/**
 * Abstract base class for value objects that provide SWF callers with
 * information about a logical response to issue and the data necessary to issue
 * it.
 * <p>
 * This class is a generic marker returned from a request into an executing flow
 * has completed processing, indicating a client response needs to be issued. An
 * instance of a ViewSelection subclass represents the selection of a concrete
 * response type. It is expected that callers introspect the returned view
 * selection instance to handle the response types they support.
 * <p>
 * View selections are returned as a result of entering a {@link ViewState} or
 * {@link EndState}, typically created by those states delegating to a
 * {@link ViewSelector} factory (a creational strategy). When a state of either
 * of those types is entered and returns, the caller into the web flow system is
 * handed a fully-configured <code>ViewSelection</code> instance and is
 * expected to present some form inteface to the client that allows for
 * interaction at that point within the flow.
