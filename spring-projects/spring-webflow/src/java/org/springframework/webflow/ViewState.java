/**
 * A view state is a state in which a physical view resource should be rendered
 * to the user, for example, for soliciting form input.
 * <p>
 * To accomplish this, a <code>ViewState</code> returns a
 * {@link ViewSelection}, which contains the logical name of a view template to
 * render and all supporting model data needed to render it correctly. It is
 * expected that some sort of view resolver will map this view selection to a
 * renderable resource template (like a JSP file).
 * <p>
 * A view state can also be a <i>marker</i> state with no associated view. In
 * this case it just returns control back to the client. Marker states are
 * useful for situations where an action or custom state type has already
 * generated the response.
