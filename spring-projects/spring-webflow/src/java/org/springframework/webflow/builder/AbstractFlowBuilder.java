/**
 * Base class for flow builders that programmatically build flows in Java
 * configuration code.
 * <p>
 * To give you an example of what a simple Java-based web flow builder
 * definition might look like, the following example defines the 'dynamic' web
 * flow roughly equivalent to the work flow statically implemented in Spring
 * MVC's simple form controller:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class CustomerDetailFlowBuilder extends AbstractFlowBuilder {
 *     public void buildStates() {
 *                      
 *         // get customer information
 *         addActionState(&quot;getDetails&quot;, action(&quot;customerAction&quot;),
 *             on(success(), to(&quot;displayDetails&quot;)));
 *                              
 *         // view customer information               
 *         addViewState(&quot;displayDetails&quot;, &quot;customerDetails&quot;,
 *             on(submit(), to(&quot;bindAndValidate&quot;));
 *                          
 *         // bind and validate customer information updates 
 *         addActionState(&quot;bindAndValidate&quot;, action(&quot;customerAction&quot;),
 *             new Transition[] {
 *                 on(error(), to(&quot;displayDetails&quot;)),
 *                 on(success(), to(&quot;finish&quot;))
 *         });
 *                              
 *         // finish
 *         addEndState(&quot;finish&quot;);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * What this Java-based FlowBuilder implementation does is add four states to a
 * flow. These include a "get" <code>ActionState</code> (the start state), a
 * <code>ViewState</code> state, a "bind and validate"
 * <code>ActionState</code>, and an end marker state (<code>EndState</code>).
 * 
 * The first state, an action state, will be assigned the indentifier
 * <code>getDetails</code>. This action state will automatically be
 * configured with the following defaults:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The action instance with id <code>customerAction</code>. This is the
 * <code>Action</code> implementation that will execute when this state is
 * entered. In this example, that <code>Action</code> will go out to the DB,
 * load the Customer, and put it in the Flow's request context.
 * <li>A <code>success</code> transition to a default view state, called
 * <code>displayDetails</code>. This means when the <code>Action</code>
 * returns a <code>success</code> result event (aka outcome), the
 * <code>displayDetails</code> state will be entered.
 * <li>It will act as the start state for this flow (by default, the first
 * state added to a flow during the build process is treated as the start
 * state).
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The second state, a view state, will be identified as
 * <code>displayDetails</code>. This view state will automatically be
 * configured with the following defaults:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A view name called <code>customerDetails</code>. This is the logical
 * name of a view resource. This logical view name gets mapped to a physical
 * view resource (jsp, etc.) by the calling front controller (via a Spring view
 * resolver, or a Struts action forward, for example).
 * <li>A <code>submit</code> transition to a bind and validate action state,
 * indentified by the default id <code>bindAndValidate</code>. This means
 * when a <code>submit</code> event is signaled by the view (for example, on a
 * submit button click), the bindAndValidate action state will be entered and
 * the <code>bindAndValidate</code> method of the
 * <code>customerAction</code> <code>Action</code> implementation will be
 * executed.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The third state, an action state, will be indentified as <code>
 * bindAndValidate</code>.
 * This action state will automatically be configured with the following
 * defaults:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An action bean named <code>customerAction</code> -- this is the name
 * of the <code>Action</code> implementation exported in the application
 * context that will execute when this state is entered. In this example, the
 * <code>Action</code> has a "bindAndValidate" method that will bind form
 * input in the HTTP request to a backing Customer form object, validate it, and
 * update the DB.
 * <li>A <code>success</code> transition to a default end state, called
 * <code>finish</code>. This means if the <code>Action</code> returns a
 * <code>success</code> result, the <code>finish</code> end state will be
 * transitioned to and the flow will terminate.
 * <li>An <code>error</code> transition back to the form view. This means if
 * the <code>Action</code> returns an <code>error</code> event, the <code>
 * displayDetails</code>
 * view state will be transitioned back to.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The fourth and last state, an end state, will be indentified with the default
 * end state id <code>finish</code>. This end state is a marker that signals
 * the end of the flow. When entered, the flow session terminates, and if this
 * flow is acting as a root flow in the current flow execution, any
 * flow-allocated resources will be cleaned up. An end state can optionally be
 * configured with a logical view name to forward to when entered. It will also
 * trigger a state transition in a resuming parent flow if this flow was
 * participating as a spawned 'subflow' within a suspended parent flow.
