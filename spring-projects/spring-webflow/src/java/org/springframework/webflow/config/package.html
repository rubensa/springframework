Contains interfaces and classes for building and assembling web flows.
</p>

<p>
You construct a web flow using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.config.FlowBuilder}.
This package defines the following flow builder implementations:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.AbstractFlowBuilder} - A
convenience superclass to use when you want to assemble the web flow
in Java code.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.XmlFlowBuilder} - A flow
builder that reads an XML file containing a web flow definition and
constructs the flow accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
During flow construction, a flow builder will need to locate a number of
<i>services</i> required by the web flow: actions, other flows, attribute
mappers and so on. To do this, the flow builder will use a
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.FlowServiceLocator}. Most
Spring applications will use the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.BeanFactoryFlowServiceLocator},
which is also the default.
</p>

<p>
To actually direct flow construction, you use the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.FlowFactoryBean}. This is a
normal Spring factory bean that uses a flow builder to construct a web flow.
