Contains interfaces and classes for building and assembling web flows.
</p>

<p>
You construct a web flow using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.config.FlowBuilder}.
This package defines the following flow builder implementations:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.AbstractFlowBuilder} - A
convenience superclass to use when you want to assemble the web flow
in Java code.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.XmlFlowBuilder} - A flow
builder that reads an XML file containing a web flow definition and
constructs the flow accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
During flow construction, a flow builder will need to locate a number of
<i>artifacts</i> required by the flow definition in the Spring bean factory:
actions, other flows, attribute mappers and so on.
</p>
<p>
To direct flow construction, you use the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.registry.FlowAssembler}.
This is based on the class GoF builder design pattern.
