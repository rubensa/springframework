Contains interfaces and classes for registering and refreshing web flows in a registry.

You can construct a generic, initially empty FlowRegistry, and then populate it
with Flow definitions using a FlowRegistrar as follows:
<pre>
    BeanFactory beanFactory = ...
    FlowRegistryImpl registry = new FlowRegistryImpl();
    Resource[] locations = new Resource[] {
       "/WEB-INF/flowA.xml",
       "/WEB-INF/flowB.xml"
    };
    XmlFlowRegistrar registrar = new XmlFlowRegistrar(new BeanFactoryFlowArtifactLocator(beanFactory), locations);
    registrar.registerFlowDefinitions(registry);
</pre>
</p>
