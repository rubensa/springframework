	Spring Web Flow DTD
	Authors: Erwin Vervaet, Keith Donald
	
	This DTD defines the web flow XML syntax. Web flows capture the page flow
	in (part of) a web application.

	XML documents that conform to this DTD should declare the following doctype:

	<!DOCTYPE webflow PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD WEBFLOW//EN"
		"http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-webflow.dtd">
-->

<!--
	Defines the root element for a web flow definition. Web flows
	are composed of one or more states.
-->
<!ELEMENT webflow ( property*, ( action-state | view-state | decision-state | subflow-state | end-state )+, exception-handler*, bean* )>

<!--
	Unique identifier of the web flow; should be unique to all other web flows.
-->
<!ATTLIST webflow id ID #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Identifies the start state of the flow: the state where flow
	execution will begin.
-->
<!ATTLIST webflow start-state IDREF #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Defines an action state: a state where an action is executed.
	Transitions triggered by the action(s) lead on to other states.
-->
<!ELEMENT action-state ( property*, entry-action?, action+, transition+, exit-action?, exception-handler* )>

<!--
	Unique identifier of an action state; must be unique to this flow.
-->
<!ATTLIST action-state id ID #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Defines a single action to be executed.
-->
<!ELEMENT action ( property* )>

<!--
	Identifier of the action implementation exported in the configured registry, typically
	the Spring Bean Factory. This is similar to the <ref bean="myBean"/> notation of
	the Spring beans DTD.
-->
<!ATTLIST action bean CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional name qualifier for the action. When specified, the action will
	qualify execution result event identifiers by this name. An action with
	a name is often referred to as a "named action".
-->
<!ATTLIST action name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Name of the target method to be invoked to execute this action. The method's signature must
	be of the form: 'public Event ${method}(RequestContext) throws Exception'
-->
<!ATTLIST action method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Defines a transition from one state to another. Transitions define the supported 
	paths through the flow.
-->
<!ELEMENT transition ( property*, action* )>

<!--
	The criteria that triggers this transition, typically taking into account the
	last event that occured in this flow. The exact interpretation of the attribute value depends
	on the TextToTransitionCriteria converter that is installed. The most basic value is a 
	static event id (e.g on="success"). Sophisticated, custom transitional expressions are also
	supported (e.g on="${#result == 'submit' && flowScope.attribute == 'foo'}, or
	on="bean:myCustomCriteria").
-->
<!ATTLIST transition on CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Target state of the transition.
-->
<!ATTLIST transition to IDREF #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Defines a view state: a state where a view will be rendered and control will be 
	returned to the user.
	Transitions triggered by user input from the view lead on to other states.
-->
<!ELEMENT view-state ( property*, entry-action?, transition+, exit-action?, exception-handler* )>

<!--
	Unique identifier of a view state; must be unique to this flow.
-->
<!ATTLIST view-state id ID #REQUIRED>

<!--
	The name of the view that is expected to render when this view state is entered.
	When no view name is provided, this view state will act as a marker view state. A marker
	view state does not request the rendering of a view, it only pauses the flow and returns control 
	the client. Use a marker end state when another object is expected to generate the response.
	
	While this value may be a static view name, it may also be qualified with a prefix to denote a
	specific (possibly custom) ViewSelector strategy.  The "redirect:" prefix triggers creation of a
	RedirectViewSelector which will request a redirect to a specific URL (e.g. redirect:/home.htm).
	The "bean:" prefix will plug in the custom ViewSelector implementation with that bean id.
	The exact semantics are defined by the installed TextToViewSelector converter.
-->
<!ATTLIST view-state view CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Defines state entry logic to be executed.  This logic will always execute when this state is entered.
-->
<!ELEMENT entry-action ( action+ )>

<!--
	Defines state exit logic to be executed.  This logic will always execute when this state is exited 
	regardless of what transition is executed.
-->
<!ELEMENT exit-action ( action+ )>

<!--
	Defines a decision state: a state that will evaluate one or more expressions to
	decide which state to go to next.

<!--
	A transition specification that defines a criteria expression and a state to
	transition to if the expression is true. Optionally, this element may also

<!--
	The state to transition to if the expression is false (optional).
-->
<!ATTLIST if else IDREF #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Defines a sub flow state: a state that spawns a sub flow when entered. When the
	sub flow completes execution (reaches an end state), the result of subflow execution
	will be used as grounds for a transition out of this state.
-->
<!ELEMENT subflow-state ( property*, entry-action?, attribute-mapper?, transition+, exit-action?, exception-handler* )>

<!--
	A single input mapping that maps an attribute from this flow to the subflow.

	map to the subflow. When used, you will also need to specify an 'as'
	attribute. Use this OR the name attribute, not both.

<!ATTLIST input value CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The name of the target attribute in the subflow. This is optional when used in
	conjunction with the 'name' attribute; by default, the same attribute name will be
	used between this flow and the subflow.

<!ELEMENT end-state ( property*, entry-action?, exception-handler* )>

<!--
	Unique identifier of an end state; must be unique to this flow.
-->
<!ATTLIST end-state id ID #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Optional name of the view that is expected to be rendered when this state is reached

	A marker end state does request the rendering of a view, it only returns control to the client.
	Use a marker end state when another object is expected to generate the response.

	While this value may be a static view name, it may also be qualified with a prefix to denote a
	specific (possibly custom) ViewDescriptorCreator strategy. The "class:" prefix allows you to 
	define a custom ViewDescriptorCreator implementation (e.g class:example.MyViewDescriptorCreator).
	The "redirect:" prefix triggers creation of a RedirectViewDescriptorCreator which will request a
	redirect to a specific URL (e.g. redirect:/home.htm). The exact capabilities are defined by the 
	installed TextToViewDescriptorCreator.

	TransitionCriteria,	or FlowAttributeMapper.
	
	A webflow bean definition may reference any other bean defined in this file, as well as 
	beans managed in the registry associated with the builder that constructed this flow.

	A bean definition may contain nested tags for constructor arguments,
	property values, lookup methods, and replaced methods. Mixing constructor

-->
<!ELEMENT bean (
	description?,
	(constructor-arg | property | lookup-method | replaced-method)*
)>

<!--
	Beans can be identified by an id, to enable reference checking.

	There are constraints on a valid XML id: if you want to reference your bean
	in Java code using a name that's illegal as an XML id, use the optional
	"name" attribute. If neither is given, the bean class name is used as id
	(with an appended counter like "#2" if there is already a bean with that name).
-->
<!ATTLIST bean id ID #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional. Can be used to create one or more aliases illegal in an id.
	Multiple aliases can be separated by any number of spaces or commas.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Each bean definition must specify the fully qualified name of the class,
	except if it pure serves as parent for child bean definitions.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean class CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optionally specify a parent bean definition.

	Will use the bean class of the parent if none specified, but can
	also override it. In the latter case, the child bean class must be
	compatible with the parent, i.e. accept the parent's property values
	and constructor argument values, if any.

	A child bean definition will inherit constructor argument values,
	property values and method overrides from the parent, with the option
	to add new values. If init method, destroy method, factory bean and/or factory
	method are specified, they will override the corresponding parent settings.

	The remaining settings will always be taken from the child definition:
	depends on, autowire mode, dependency check, singleton, lazy init.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean parent CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Is this bean "abstract", i.e. not meant to be instantiated itself but
	rather just serving as parent for concrete child bean definitions.
	Default is "false". Specify "true" to tell the bean factory to not try to
	instantiate that particular bean in any case.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean abstract (true | false) "false">

<!--
	Is this bean a "singleton" (one shared instance, which will
	be returned by all calls to getBean() with the id),
	or a "prototype" (independent instance resulting from each call to
	getBean(). Default is singleton.

	Singletons are most commonly used, and are ideal for multi-threaded
	service objects.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean singleton (true | false) "true">

<!--
	If this bean should be lazily initialized.
	If false, it will get instantiated on startup by bean factories
	that perform eager initialization of singletons.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean lazy-init (true | false | default) "default">

<!--
	Optional attribute controlling whether to "autowire" bean properties.
	This is an automagical process in which bean references don't need to be coded
	explicitly in the XML bean definition file, but Spring works out dependencies.

	There are 5 modes:

	1. "no"
	The traditional Spring default. No automagical wiring. Bean references
	must be defined in the XML file via the <ref> element. We recommend this
	in most cases as it makes documentation more explicit.

	2. "byName"
	Autowiring by property name. If a bean of class Cat exposes a dog property,
	Spring will try to set this to the value of the bean "dog" in the current factory.
	If there is no matching bean by name, nothing special happens;
	use dependency-check="objects" to raise an error in that case.

	3. "byType"
	Autowiring if there is exactly one bean of the property type in the bean factory.
	If there is more than one, a fatal error is raised, and you can't use byType
	autowiring for that bean. If there is none, nothing special happens;
	use dependency-check="objects" to raise an error in that case.

	4. "constructor"
	Analogous to "byType" for constructor arguments. If there isn't exactly one bean
	of the constructor argument type in the bean factory, a fatal error is raised.

	5. "autodetect"
	Chooses "constructor" or "byType" through introspection of the bean class.
	If a default constructor is found, "byType" gets applied.

	The latter two are similar to PicoContainer and make bean factories simple to
	configure for small namespaces, but doesn't work as well as standard Spring
	behaviour for bigger applications.

	Note that explicit dependencies, i.e. "property" and "constructor-arg" elements,
	always override autowiring. Autowire behaviour can be combined with dependency
	checking, which will be performed after all autowiring has been completed.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean autowire (no | byName | byType | constructor | autodetect | default) "default">

<!--
	Optional attribute controlling whether to check whether all this
	beans dependencies, expressed in its properties, are satisfied.
	Default is no dependency checking.

	"simple" type dependency checking includes primitives and String
	"object" includes collaborators (other beans in the factory)
	"all" includes both types of dependency checking
-->
<!ATTLIST bean dependency-check (none | objects | simple | all | default) "default">

<!--
	The names of the beans that this bean depends on being initialized.
	The bean factory will guarantee that these beans get initialized before.

	Note that dependencies are normally expressed through bean properties or
	constructor arguments. This property should just be necessary for other kinds
	of dependencies like statics (*ugh*) or database preparation on startup.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean depends-on CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional attribute for the name of the custom initialization method
	to invoke after setting bean properties. The method must have no arguments,
	but may throw any exception.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean init-method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional attribute for the name of the custom destroy method to invoke
	on bean factory shutdown. The method must have no arguments,
	but may throw any exception. Note: Only invoked on singleton beans!
-->
<!ATTLIST bean destroy-method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional attribute specifying the name of a factory method to use to
	create this object. Use constructor-arg elements to specify arguments
	to the factory method, if it takes arguments. Autowiring does not apply
	to factory methods.

	If the "class" attribute is present, the factory method will be a static
	method on the class specified by the "class" attribute on this bean
	definition. Often this will be the same class as that of the constructed
	object - for example, when the factory method is used as an alternative
	to a constructor. However, it may be on a different class. In that case,
	the created object will *not* be of the class specified in the "class"
	attribute. This is analogous to FactoryBean behavior.

	If the "factory-bean" attribute is present, the "class" attribute is not
	used, and the factory method will be an instance method on the object
	returned from a getBean call with the specified bean name. The factory
	bean may be defined as a singleton or a prototype.

	The factory method can have any number of arguments. Autowiring is not
	supported. Use indexed constructor-arg elements in conjunction with the
	factory-method attribute.

	Setter Injection can be used in conjunction with a factory method.
	Method Injection cannot, as the factory method returns an instance,
	which will be used when the container creates the bean.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean factory-method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Alternative to class attribute for factory-method usage.
	If this is specified, no class attribute should be used.
	This should be set to the name of a bean in the current or
	ancestor factories that contains the relevant factory method.
	This allows the factory itself to be configured using Dependency
	Injection, and an instance (rather than static) method to be used.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean factory-bean CDATA #IMPLIED>


<!--
	Bean definitions can specify zero or more constructor arguments.
	This is an alternative to "autowire constructor".
	Arguments correspond to either a specific index of the constructor argument
	list or are supposed to be matched generically by type.

	Note: A single generic argument value will just be used once, rather than
	potentially matched multiple times (as of Spring 1.1).

	constructor-arg elements are also used in conjunction with the factory-method
	element to construct beans using static or instance factory methods.
-->
<!ELEMENT constructor-arg (
	description?,
	(bean | ref | idref | value | null | list | set | map | props)?

<!--
	The constructor-arg tag can have an optional index attribute,
	to specify the exact index in the constructor argument list. Only needed
	to avoid ambiguities, e.g. in case of 2 arguments of the same type.
-->
<!ATTLIST constructor-arg index CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The constructor-arg tag can have an optional type attribute,
	to specify the exact type of the constructor argument. Only needed
	to avoid ambiguities, e.g. in case of 2 single argument constructors
	that can both be converted from a String.

<!ATTLIST constructor-arg value CDATA #IMPLIED>


<!--
	A property associated with an another element (action, state, ...). Properties are simple
	strings or typed information that allow you to annotate the element.
	For example, the 'caption' property might serve a GUI tooltip or logging statement, and
	the 'validatorMethod' property might specify a target method to invoke on a form action's
	validator in a particular action state.

	Bean definitions can have also zero or more properties.
	Property elements correspond to JavaBean setter methods exposed
	by the bean classes. Spring supports primitives, references to other
	beans in the same or related factories, lists, maps and properties.

<!--
	A lookup method causes the IoC container to override the given method and return
	the bean with the name given in the bean attribute. This is a form of Method Injection.
	It's particularly useful as an alternative to implementing the BeanFactoryAware
	interface, in order to be able to make getBean() calls for non-singleton instances
	at runtime. In this case, Method Injection is a less invasive alternative.

-->
<!ATTLIST lookup-method bean CDATA #IMPLIED>


<!--
	Similar to the lookup method mechanism, the replaced-method element is used to control
