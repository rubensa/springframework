 * An 'observer' that is very aspect like, allowing you to insert 'cross
 * cutting' behavior at well-defined points within one or more flow execution
 * lifecycles.
 * <p>
 * For example, one custom listener my apply security checks at the flow
 * execution level, preventing a flow from starting or a state from entering if
 * the curent user does not have the necessary permissions. Another listener may
 * track flow execution navigation history to support bread crumbs. Another may
 * perform auditing, or setup and tear down connections to a transactional
 * resource.
