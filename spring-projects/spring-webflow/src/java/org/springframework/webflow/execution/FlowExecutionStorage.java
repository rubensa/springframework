/**
 * Storage strategy for flow executions. A flow execution manager uses
 * this interface to load and save flow executions.
 * <p>
 * Note that the flow execution storage strategy can have an impact
 * on application transaction management for a flow execution. For instance,
 * the default application transaction synchronization implementation
 * ({@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowScopeTokenTransactionSynchronizer})
 * uses a simple <i>synchronizer token</i> stored in the flow scope, which
 * implies that there is a single flow execution for an application transaction.
 * Some flow execution storage strategies (like
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.ClientContinuationFlowExecutionStorage})
 * create copies (clones) of a flow execution to enable <i>free browsing</i>
 * in a flow. Those strategies are not compatible with the default application
 * transaction implementation. Usually this is not a problem since free browing
 * is not really compatible with any kind of transactional semantics. If required,
 * you can always plug in another transaction synchronizer, e.g. one that stores
 * a transaction token in the database, thus no longer requiring a single
 * flow execution per application transaction.
