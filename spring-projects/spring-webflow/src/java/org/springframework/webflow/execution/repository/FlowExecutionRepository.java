 * <p>
 * Flow execution repositories are responsible for managing the creation,
 * storage, restoration, and invalidation of conversations between clients and
 * the Spring Web Flow system.
 * <p>
 * When placed in a repository, a {@link FlowExecution} object representing the
 * state of a conversation at a point in time is indexed under a unique
 * {@link FlowExecutionKey}. This key provides enough information to track a
 * single active user conversation with the server, as well as provide an index
 * into one or more restorable conversational snapshots taken at points in time
 * during conversation execution. These restorable conversational snapshots are
 * also called <i>continuations</i>.
