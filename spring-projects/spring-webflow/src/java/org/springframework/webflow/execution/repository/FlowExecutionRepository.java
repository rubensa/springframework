 * <p>
 * Flow execution repositories are responsible for managing the creation,
 * storage, restoration, and invalidation of conversations between clients and
 * the Spring Web Flow system.
 * <p>
 * When placed in a repository, a {@link FlowExecution} object representing the
 * state of a conversation at a point in time is indexed under a unique
 * {@link FlowExecutionContinuationKey}. This key provides enough information
 * to track a single active user conversation with the server, as well as
 * provide an index into one or more restorable conversational snapshots taken
 * at points in time during conversation execution. These restorable
 * conversational snapshots are called <i>continuations</i>.
