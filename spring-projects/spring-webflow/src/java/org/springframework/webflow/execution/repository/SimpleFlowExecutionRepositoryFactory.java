 * Convenient implementation that encapsulates the assembly of a <i>simple</i>

 * <ul>
 * Specifically, <i>simple</i> means this delegating repository factory:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sets a {@link SharedMapFlowExecutionRepositoryFactory} to manage flow
 * execution repository implementations statefully in the
 * {@link ExternalContext#getSessionMap()}, typically backed by the HTTP
 * session.
 * <li>Configures it with a simple repository creator to create instances of
 * {@link SimpleFlowExecutionRepository} when requested for placement in the
 * shared session map.
 * </ul>
 * This class inherits from {@link FlowExecutionRepositoryServices} to allow for
 * direct configuration of services needed by the repositories created by this
 * factory.
