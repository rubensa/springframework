/**
 * Flow execution storage that stores flow executions as <i>continuations</i>
 * in the HttpSession.
 * <p>
 * A downside of this storage strategy (and of server-side continuations in general)
 * is that there could be many copies of the flow execution stored in the HTTP
 * session, increasing server memory requirements. It is advised that you use the
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.support.ExpiredFlowCleanupFilter} to
 * cleanup any flow execution continuations as soon as the can be considered
 * to have expired.
 * <p>
 * This storage strategy requires a <code>HttpServletRequestEvent</code>.
