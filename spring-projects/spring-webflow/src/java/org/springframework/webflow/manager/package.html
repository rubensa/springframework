Supports the execution of flow definitions.
</p>
<p>
The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecution}, representing
a single instance of an executing flow (also known as a "dialog" or "web conversation").
</p>
<p>
The following classes and interfaces are of particular interest to the user of
the web flow system:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionManager} - A facade 
clients (e.g. controllers) can use as an entry-point into Spring Web Flow for launching 
and executing flows.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionRepository} - A repository interface
used by the flow execution manager to store the state of an ongoing flow execution.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionListener} - The listener
interface to be implemented by objects that are interested in flow execution
lifecycle events. The class
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionListenerAdapter}
provides an adapter to ease subclassing. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This package depends on the webflow root package.
