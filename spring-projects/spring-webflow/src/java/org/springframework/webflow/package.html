Contains core interfaces and classes for dealing with web flows.
The core concepts used at configuration time to define a flow are covered
by this package. These concepts then drive flow execution at runtime.
As such this package provides the basic layer on which all other layers
of the web flow system build, most importantly the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config configuration layer}
and
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution execution layer}.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.springframework.webflow.Flow web flow} is composed of a
set of {@link org.springframework.webflow.State states}. A state is a point in the
flow where something happens; for instance,
{@link org.springframework.webflow.ViewState displaying a view} or
{@link org.springframework.webflow.ActionState executing an action}.
Each state has one or more {@link org.springframework.webflow.Transition transitions}
that are used to move to another state.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, this package also defines a number of interfaces related to flow execution.
The central concepts in this regard are the {@link org.springframework.webflow.RequestContext}
and its sub interface {@link org.springframework.webflow.FlowExecutionControlContext},
which is used by all artifacts of a web flow to gain access to information about an
ongoing flow execution and to manipulate that flow execution. The
<code>FlowExecutionControlContext</code> is also the primary facade used by clients of the
core web flow system, e.g. the {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution execution layer}.
</p>

<p>
To the end user of the system, the following extension points are of importance:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.Action} - The interface implemented
by actions executed by a web flow in an action state. Ready to use
implementations and convenience superclasses are provided in
the {@link org.springframework.webflow.action} package.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.FlowAttributeMapper} - The interface
implemented by strategy objects used to map attributes between flow
scopes. An out-of-the-box implementation is provided by the class
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.ParameterizableFlowAttributeMapper}.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.ViewSelector} - A factory that
produces a new, configured {@link org.springframework.webflow.ViewSelection}
instance on each invocation, taking into account the contextual information
about an ongoing flow execution.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.TransitionCriteria} - The interface for
strategy objects encapsulating criteria that determine whether or not a
transition should execute given the current state of a flow execution.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This package has several sub packages:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.access access} - Contains interfaces and classes for 
retrieving flow artifacts at runtime.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.action action} - Out-of-the box action implementations
that address common controller concerns.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config config} - Contains interfaces and classes for
building and assembling web flows at configuration time.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.config.registry config.registry} - This package contains
interfaces and classes for working with flow definition registries.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution execution} - Provides classes supporting managed
flow execution.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.jsf jsf} - Integration of the Spring web flow system
with JavaServer Faces (JSF).
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.mvc mvc} - Integration of the Spring web flow system
into the Spring web MVC framework.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.struts struts} - Integration of the Spring web flow
system with Struts 1.x.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.test test} - Contains classes that assist in testing
web flows and their associated artifacts.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.util util} - General purpose utility classes used by the
web flow system.
</li>
</ul>
