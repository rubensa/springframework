Contains core interfaces and classes for dealing with web flows.
</p>

<p>The core concepts used at configuration time to define a flow are covered
by this package. A {@link org.springframework.web.flow.Flow web flow} is composed of a
set of {@link org.springframework.web.flow.State states}. A state is a point in the
flow where something happens; for instance,
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.ViewState displaying a view} or
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.ActionState executing an action}.
Each state has one or more {@link org.springframework.web.flow.Transition transitions}
that are used to move to another state.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, this package also defines a number of interfaces related to flow execution.
The central concept in this regard is the {@link org.springframework.web.flow.RequestContext},
which is used by all artifacts of a web flow to gain access to information about an
ongoing flow execution.
</p>

<p>
To the end user of the system, the following extension points are of importance:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.Action} - The interface implemented
by actions executed by a web flow in an action state. Ready to use
implementations and convenience superclasses are provided in
the {@link org.springframework.web.flow.action} package.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.FlowAttributeMapper} - The interface
implemented by strategy objects used to map attributes between flow
scopes. An out-of-the-box implementation is provided by the class
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.support.ParameterizableFlowAttributeMapper}.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.ViewDescriptorCreator} -  A factory that
produces a new, configured <code>ViewDescriptor</code> on each invocation,
taking into account the information in the ongoing flow execution.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.TransitionCriteria} - The interface for
strategy objects encapsulating criteria that determine whether or not a
transition should execute given the current state of a flow execution.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This package has several sub packages:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.action action} - Out-of-the box action implementations
that address common controller concerns.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.config config} - Contains interfaces and classes for
building and assembling web flows.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.execution execution} - Provides classes supporting managed
flow execution.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.mvc mvc} - Integration of the Spring web flow system
into the Spring web MVC framework.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.portlet portlet} - Integration of the Spring web flow system
into the Spring portlet MVC framework.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.struts struts} - Integration of the Spring web flow
system with Struts 1.x.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.web.flow.support support} - This package contains interfaces and
classes supporting the Spring web flow system.
</li>
</ul>
