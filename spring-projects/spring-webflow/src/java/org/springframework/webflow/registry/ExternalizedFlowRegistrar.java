/**
 * A flow registrar that populates a flow registry from flow definitions defined
 * within externalized resources. Encapsulates registration behaivior common to
 * all externalized registrars and is not tied to a specific flow definition
 * format (e.g. xml).
 * <p>
 * Concrete subclasses are expected to derive from this class to provide
 * knowledge about a particular kind of definition format by implementing the
 * abstract template methods in this class.
 * <p>
 * By default, when configuring the <code>flowLocations</code> property, flow
 * definition registered by this registrar will be assigned a registry
 * identifier equal to the filename of the underlying definition resource, minus
 * the filename extension. For example, a XML-based flow definition defined in
 * the file "flow1.xml" will be identified as "flow1" when registered in a
 * registry.
 * <p>
 * For full control over the assignment of flow identifiers and flow properties,
 * configure formal
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.registry.ExternalizedFlowDefinition}
 * instances using the <code>flowDefinitions</code> property.
