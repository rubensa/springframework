/**
 * A strategy to use to populate a flow registry with one or more flow
 * definitions.
 * <p>
 * Flow registrars encapsulate the knowledge about the source of a set of flow
 * definition resources, and the behavior necessary to add those resources to a
 * flow registry.
 * <p>
 * The typical usage pattern is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a new (initially empty) flow registry.
 * <li>Create a flow artifact factory that will create flow artifacts during the flow
 * registration process.
 * <li>Use any number of flow registrars to populate the registry by calling
 * {@link #registerFlows(FlowRegistry, FlowArtifactFactory)}.
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This design where various FlowRegistrars populate a generic FlowRegistry was
 * inspired by Spring's GenericApplicationContext, which can use any number of
 * BeanDefinitionReaders to drive context population.
