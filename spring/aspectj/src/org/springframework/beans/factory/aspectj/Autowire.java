/**
 * Enumeration determining autowiring status: that is, whether a bean should
 * have its dependencies automatically injected by the Spring container using
 * setter injection. This is a core concept in Spring DI.
 *
 * <p>This enumeration is intended for use with Spring's Configurable annotation
 * and its associated AnnotationBeanConfigurer aspect (for AspectJ). Note that
 * constructor autowiring is not available here, as our aspect is not in control
 * over bean instantiation.
