Important incompatible changes from 1.0 RC1 to 1.0 RC2
======================================================


1. Small, but non-backwards-compatible JNDI configuration change

'inContainer' property of AbstractJndiLocator and derived subclasses such as JndiObjectFactoryBean
and the EJB invokers has become 'resourceRef', and the default value is now false, not true.

MIGRATION: If your old JNDI locations had a scheme (i.e. started with 'java:' or any 'xxxx:' value) you
do not have to do anything. If your old JNDI location had no scheme specified, Spring will no longer by
default prepend 'java:comp/env/' to it. To get the old behaviour, just add the resourceRef property with
a true value. Alternately just add the 'java:comp/env/' prefix yourself to the JNDI location path.


2. Change in AOP API with impact on some user applications (easy to fix)

Now the only subinterfaces of Advisor are PointcutAdvisor and IntroductionAdvisor. There is no longer
a parallel hierarchy of Advisors and Advice: DefaultPointcutAdvisor can be used to hold any advice type
(Interceptor, MethodBeforeAdvice etc).

MIGRATION: If you used or extended a class like DefaultMethodBeforeAdvisor, replace that with
DefaultPointcutAdvisor. If you used RegexpMethodPointcutAroundAdvisor, replace with RegexpMethodPoincutAdvisor.
Note that regular expressions can now be used to target any advice type.
