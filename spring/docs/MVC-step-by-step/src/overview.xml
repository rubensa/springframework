  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>This document is a step-by-step guide on how to develop a web
  application from scratch using the Spring Framework.</para>

  <para>Only a cursory knowledge of Spring itself is assumed, and as such this
  tutorial is ideal if you are learning or investigating Spring. Hopefully by
  the time you have worked your way through the tutorial material you will see
  how the constituent parts of the Spring Framework, namely Inversion of
  Control (IoC), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and the various Spring
  service libraries (such as the JDBC library) all fit together in the context
  of a Spring MVC web application.</para>

  <para>Please note that we are not going to cover any background information
  or theory in this tutorial; there are plenty of books available that cover
  the areas in depth; whenever a new class or feature is used in the tutorial,
  forward pointers to the relevant section(s) of the Spring reference
  documentation are provided where the class or feature is covered in
  depth.</para>

  <section id="overview-whats-covered">
    <title>What's covered</title>

    Framework that are covered over the course of the tutorial.</para>

    <title>Prerequisite software</title>

    <para>The following prerequisite software and environment setup is
    assumed. You should also be reasonably comfortable using the following
    technologies.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Java SDK 1.5</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ant 1.7</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Apache Tomcat 6.0.14</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Eclipse 3.3 (Recommended, but not necessary)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      <emphasis>Eclipse 3.3 Europa (http://www.eclipse.org/europa) with the 
      Web Tools Platform (WTP) Project (http://www.eclipse.org/webtools) 
      and the Spring IDE Project (http://www.springide.org) provides an excellent
      envirnment for web development.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>You may of course use pretty much any variation or version of
      the above software. If you want to use NetBeans or IntelliJ instead of
      Eclipse or Jetty instead of Tomcat, then many of the tutorial steps will
      not translate directly to your environment but you should be able to
      follow along anyway.</emphasis>

    <title>The application we are building</title>

    <para>The application we will be building from scratch over the course of
    this tutorial is a <emphasis>very basic</emphasis> inventory management
    system. This inventory management system is severely constrained in terms
    of scope; find below a use case diagram illustrating the simple use cases
    that we will be implementing. The reason why the application is so
    constrained is so that you can concentrate on the specifics of Spring Web
    MVC and Spring, and not the finer details of inventory management.</para>

    <para>We will <link linkend="part1">start</link> by setting up the basic
    project directory structure for our application, downloading the required
    libraries, setting up our Ant build scripts, etc. The first step gives us
    a solid foundation on which to develop the application proper in parts
    <link linkend="part2">2</link>, <link linkend="part3">3</link>, and <link
    linkend="part4">4</link>.</para>

    <para>Once the basic setup is out of the way, Spring itself will be
    introduced, starting with the Spring Web MVC framework. We will use Spring
    Web MVC to display the inventoried stock, which will involve writing some
    simple Java classes and some JSPs. We will then move onto introducing
    persistent data access into our application, using Spring's Simple JDBC
    support.</para>

    <para>By the time we have finished all of the steps in the tutorial, we
    will have an application that does basic inventory management, including
    listing stock and permitting the price increase of such stock.</para>
