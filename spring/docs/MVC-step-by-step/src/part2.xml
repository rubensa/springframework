    <title>Improve index.jsp</title>

    <para>We will make use of JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) so I will start by copying the JSTL files we need to our WEB-INF/lib directory. 
	Copy jstl.jar from the 'spring-framework-1.2/lib/j2ee' directory and standard.jar from the 'spring-framework-1.2/lib/jakarta-taglibs' directory 
	to the springapp/war/WEB-INF/lib directory. I am also creating a “header” file that will be included in every JSP page that I'm going to write. 
	This will make development easier and I will be sure that I have the same definitions in all JSPs. I am going to put all JSPs in a directory 
	named jsp under the WEB-INF directory. This will ensure that only the controller has access to the views - it is not possible to get to these pages 
	by entering them directly as a URL in the browser. This strategy might not work in all application servers and if this is the case with the one you 
	are using, just move the jsp directory up a level. You would then use springapp/war/jsp as the directory instead of springapp/war/WEB-INF/jsp in all 
	the code examples that will follow.</para>

      <title>Improve the view and the controller</title>
      <para>I am going to move the view hello.jsp to the WEB-INF/jsp directory. The same include that was added to index.jsp gets added to hello.jsp. 
	I also add the current date and time as output that I will retrieve from the model, passed to the view, using the JSTL &lt;c:out&gt; tag.</para>
