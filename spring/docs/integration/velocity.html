        <h1>Spring - Velocity configuration example</h1>
        <p>Darren Davison, Oct. 2003</p>
        
        <p>
            This is a short document showing how to configure a Spring MVC application for use with
            <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a> view technology.  Spring 
            integrates many view technologies, of which Velocity is one.  This is not a tutorial
            on Spring MVC, or Velocity for which other resources are readily available.  The example
            configuration was tested using velocity-1.3.1 and spring-full-1.0M1
        </p>
        
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>
            There is one dependency that your web application will need to satisfy before
            working with Velocity, namely that <code>velocity-1.x.x.jar</code> needs to be available.  
            Typically this is included in the WEB-INF/lib folder where it is guaranteed to be found
            by a J2EE server and added to the classpath for your application.   It is of course 
            assumed that you already have the <code>spring-full.jar</code> (or equivalent) in your
            WEB-INF/lib folder too!  The latest stable velocity jar is normally supplied as part
            of the Spring framework and can be copied from there.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
            A few files are considered for correct configuration of the Velocity environment:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dispatcher servlet context</h3>
        <p>
            The configuration file for your Spring dispatcher servlet (usually 
            <code>WEB-INF/[servletname]-servlet.xml</code>) should already contain a bean
            definition for the view resolver.  We'll also add a bean here to configure the
            Velocity environment.  I've chosen to call my dispatcher 'frontcontroller' so my config
            file names reflect this.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The following code examples show the various configuration files with appropriate 
            comments.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Partial WEB-INF/frontcontroller-servlet.xml</h4>
        <pre class="code">
        <span class="comment">
&lt;!-- ===========================================================--&gt;
&lt;!-- View resolver. Required by web framework.                  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ===========================================================--&gt;
&lt;!--
    View resolvers can be configured with ResourceBundles or XML files.  If you need
    different view resolving based on Locale, you have to use the resource bundle resolver, 
    otherwise it makes no difference.  I simply prefer to keep the Spring configs and 
    contexts in XML.  See Spring documentation for more info.
--&gt;</span>
&lt;bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.XmlViewResolver"&gt;
    &lt;property name="cache"&gt;&lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="location"&gt;&lt;value&gt;/WEB-INF/frontcontroller-views.xml&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

    The next bean sets up the Velocity environment for us based on a properties file, the 
    location of which is supplied here and set on the bean in the normal way.  My example shows
    that the bean will expect to find our velocity.properties file in the root of the 
    WEB-INF folder.  In fact, since this is the default location, it's not necessary for me
    to supply it here.  Another possibility would be to specify all of the velocity
    properties here in a property set called "velocityProperties" and dispense with the
    actual velocity.properties file altogether.
--&gt;</span>
&lt;bean 
    id="velocityConfig" 
    class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.velocity.VelocityConfigurer"
    singleton="true"&gt;
    &lt;property name="configLocation"&gt;&lt;value&gt;/WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;          
&lt;/bean&gt;
        </pre>
        
        
        <h3>Velocity.properties</h3>
        <p>
            This file contains the values that are passed to the Velocity runtime in order to
            configure velocity itself.  Only a few properties are actually required, but many more
            optional properties are available - see the Velocity docs for more information.  Here,
            I'm just demonstrating the bare minimum to get Velocity up and running in your Spring
            MVC application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main property values concern the location of the Velocity templates themselves.
            Velocity templates can be loaded from the classpath or the file system and there are pros
            and cons for both.  Loading from the classpath is entirely portable and will work on all
            target servers, but you may find that the templates clutter your java packages (unless you
            create a new source tree for them).  A further downside of classpath storage is that during
            development, changing anything in the source tree often causes a refresh of the resource in
            the WEB-INF/classes tree and this in turn may cause your development server to restart the 
            application (hot-deploying of code).  This can be irritating.  Once most of the development
            is complete though, you could store the templates in a jar file which would make them
            available to the application if this were placed in WEB-INF/lib.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example stores velocity templates on the file system somewhere under WEB-INF so
            that they are not directly available to the client browsers, but don't cause an application
            restart in development every time I change one.  The downside is that the target server
            may not be able to resolve the path to these files correctly, particularly if the
            target server doesn't explode WAR modules on the file system.  The file method works
            fine for Tomcat 4.1.x, WebSphere 4.x and WebSphere 5.x.  Your mileage may vary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The file resource loader configuration above uses a marker to denote the root of
            the web application on the file system ${webapp.root}.  This marker will be
            translated into the actual OS-specific path by the Spring code prior to supplying
            the properties to Velocity.  This is what makes the file resource loader non-portable 
            in some servers.  The actual name of the marker itself can be changed if you consider it 
            important by defining a different "appRootMarker" for VelocityConfigurer.  See the Spring
            documentation for details on how to do this.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>View configuration</h3>
        <p>
            The last step in configuration is to define some views that will be rendered with
            velocity templates.  Views are always defined in a consistent manner in Spring
            context files.  As noted earlier, this example uses an XML file to define view
            beans, but a properties file (ResourceBundle) can also be used.  The name of the
            view definition file was defined earlier in our ViewResolver bean - part of the 
            <code>WEB-INF/frontcontroller-servlet.xml</code> file.
        </p>

        <pre class="code">

  Views can be hierarchical, here's an example of a parent view that 
  simply defines the class to use and sets a default template which
  will normally be overridden in child definitions.
--&gt;</span>
&lt;bean id="parentVelocityView" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.velocity.VelocityView"&gt;
    &lt;property name="templateName"&gt;&lt;value&gt;mainTemplate.vm&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;        
&lt;/bean&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!--
  - The main view for the home page.  Since we don't set a template name, the value
  from the parent is used.
--&gt;</span>
&lt;bean id="welcomeView" parent="parentVelocityView"&gt;
    &lt;property name="attributes"&gt;
        &lt;props&gt;
            &lt;prop key="title"&gt;My Velocity Home Page&lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;     
&lt;/bean&gt;  

<span class="comment">&lt;!--
  - Another view - this one defines a different velocity template.
--&gt;</span>
&lt;bean id="secondaryView" parent="parentVelocityView"&gt;
    &lt;property name="templateName"&gt;&lt;value&gt;secondaryTemplate.vm&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;  
    &lt;property name="attributes"&gt;
            &lt;props&gt;
                &lt;prop key="title"&gt;My Velocity Secondary Page&lt;/prop&gt;
            &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;    
&lt;/bean&gt;   
        </pre>
        
        
        <h3>Create velocity templates and test</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, you simply need to create the actual velocity templates.  We have defined views
            that reference two templates, <code>mainTemplate.vm</code> and <code>secondaryTemplate.vm</code>
            Both of these files will live in WEB-INF/velocity/ as noted in the velocity.properties file
            above.  If you chose a classpath loader in velocity.properties, these files would live
            in the default package (WEB-INF/classes), or in a jar file under WEB-INF/lib.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here's what our 'secondaryView' might look like (simplified HTML)
        </p>
        
        <h4>WEB-INF/velocity/secondaryTemplate.vm</h4>
        <pre class="code">
        <span class="comment">
## $title is set in the view definition file for this view.</span>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;$title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;This is $title!!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>
        
        <p>
            Now, when your controllers return a <code>ModelAndView</code> with the "secondaryView" set as the
            view to render, Velocity should kick in with the above page.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            To summarize, this is the tree structure of files discussed in the example above.  Only a 
            partial tree is shown, some required directories are not highlighted here.  Incorrect
            file locations are probably the major reason for velocity views not working, with incorrect
            properties in the view definitions a close second.
