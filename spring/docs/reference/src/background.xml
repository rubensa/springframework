    	<title>Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection</title>
    	<para>
    		In early 2004, Martin Fowler asked the readers of his site: when talking about Inversion 
    		of Control: <emphasis>"the question, is what aspect of control are they inverting?"</emphasis>.
    		After talking about the term Inversion of Control Martin suggests renaming the 
    		pattern, or at least giving it a more self-explanatory name, and starts to use the
    		term <emphasis>Dependency Injection</emphasis>. His article continues to explain some of 
    		the ideas behind Inversion of Control or Dependency Injection. If you need a decent
    		insight: <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html</ulink>.
