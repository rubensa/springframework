		<title>Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection</title>
		<para>
    		In early 2004, Martin Fowler asked the readers of his site: when talking about Inversion 
    		of Control:
    		<quote>
				<emphasis>the question is, what aspect of control are [they] inverting?</emphasis>
			</quote>.
    		After talking about the term Inversion of Control, Fowler suggested renaming the 
    		principle (or at least giving it a more self-explanatory name), and started to use the
    		term <emphasis>Dependency Injection</emphasis>. His article then continued to explain
    		the ideas underpinning the Inversion of Control (<acronym>IoC</acronym>) and Dependency
    		Injection (<acronym>DI</acronym>) principle.
