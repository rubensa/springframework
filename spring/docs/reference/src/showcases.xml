			The Spring Framework distribution also ships with a number of so-called
			<emphasis>showcase</emphasis> applications. Each showcase application provides
			fully working examples, focused on demonstrating exactly one new Spring 2.0 feature
			at a time. The idea is that you can take the code in these showcases and experiment
			with it, as opposed to having to create your own small project to test out new Spring
			2.0 features. The scope of these showcase applications is deliberately limited; the
			domain model (if there even is one) consists of maybe one or two classes, and typical
			enterprise concerns such as security, error-checking, and transactional integrity are
			omitted deliberately.
