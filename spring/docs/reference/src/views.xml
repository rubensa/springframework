		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>
			One of the areas in which Spring excels is its separation of view
            technologies from the rest of the MVC framework.  Deciding to use
            Velocity or XSLT in place of an existing JSP for example, is
            primarily a matter of configuration.  This chapter covers the
            major view technologies that work with Spring and touches briefly
            on how to add new ones.  This chapter assumes you are already
            familiar with <xref linkend="mvc-viewresolver"/> which covers the
            basics of how views in general are coupled to the MVC
            framework.</para>

			<title>Dependencies</title> 

            <para>

                There is one dependency that your web application will need to
     			satisfy before working with Velocity, namely that
     			<literal>velocity-1.x.x.jar</literal> needs to be
     			available. Typically this is included in the
     			<literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal> folder where it is guaranteed
     			to be found by a J2EE server and added to the classpath for
     			your application. It is of course assumed that you already
     			have the spring.jar in your <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal>
     			folder too! The latest stable velocity jar is supplied with
     			the Spring framework and can be copied from the
     			<literal>/lib/velocity</literal> directory.

			<para>	
			
                The configuration file for your Spring dispatcher servlet
			    (usually <literal>WEB-INF/[servletname]-servlet.xml</literal>)
			    should already contain a bean definition for the view
			    resolver. We'll also add a bean here to configure the Velocity
			    environment. I've chosen to call my dispatcher
			    'frontcontroller' so my config file names reflect this.

  View resolvers can be configured with ResourceBundles or XML files.  If you need

  otherwise it makes no difference.  I simply prefer to keep the Spring configs and 
  contexts in XML.  See Spring documentation for more info.

  The next bean sets up the Velocity environment for us based on a properties file, the 
  location of which is supplied here and set on the bean in the normal way.  My example shows
  that the bean will expect to find our velocity.properties file in the root of the 
  WEB-INF folder.  In fact, since this is the default location, it's not necessary for me
  to supply it here.  Another possibility would be to specify all of the velocity
  properties here in a property set called "velocityProperties" and dispense with the
  actual velocity.properties file altogether.

			<para>
				This file contains the values that are passed to the Velocity
			    runtime in order to configure velocity itself. Only a few
			    properties are actually required, but many more optional

			<title>Template Locations</title>
			<para>

				The main property values concern the location of the Velocity
			    templates themselves. Velocity templates can be loaded from
			    the classpath or the file system and there are pros and cons
			    for both. Loading from the classpath is entirely portable and
			    will work on all target servers, but you may find that the
			    templates clutter your java packages (unless you create a new
			    source tree for them). A further downside of classpath storage
			    is that during development, changing anything in the source
			    tree often causes a refresh of the resource in the
			    <literal>WEB-INF/classes</literal> tree and this in turn may
			    cause your development server to restart the application
			    (hot-deploying of code). This can be irritating. Once most of
			    the development is complete though, you could store the
			    templates in a jar file which would make them available to the
			    application if this were placed in
			    <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal>

            </para>

			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="view-velocity-example-velocityproperties">
			<title>Example velocity.properties</title>

			<para> 

                This example stores velocity templates on the file system
                somewhere under <literal>WEB-INF</literal> so that they are
                not directly available to the client browsers, but don't cause
                an application restart in development every time you change
                one. The downside is that the target server may not be able to
                resolve the path to these files correctly, particularly if the
                target server doesn't explode WAR modules on the file
                system. The file method works fine for Tomcat 4.1.x/5.x,
                WebSphere 4.x and WebSphere 5.x. Your mileage may vary.

				The file resource loader configuration above uses a marker to

				The last step in configuration is to define some views that

			    used. The name of the view definition file was defined earlier

			<para>
			
			    Spring provides a tag library for use in JSP's that contains
			    (amongst other things) a
			    <literal><![CDATA[<spring:bind>]]></literal> tag.  This tag
			    primarily enables forms to display the results of failed

			    The error messages that are actually produced from the

			    Spring handles this elegantly in its own way and you should
			    refer to the MVC tutorial or relevant parts of the javadocs
			    for details on how this works.  In order to gain access to the

			    There are software packages available that will automatically

			    flexibility to create the DOM from your model in any way you

                 Here, you can see how the view is tied in with the HomePage
                 class just written which handles the model domification in
                 the first property '.class'.  The stylesheetLocation property
                 obviously points to the XSLT file which will handle the XML
                 transformation into HTML for us and the final property
                 '.root' is the name that will be used as the root of the XML
                 document.  This gets passed to the HomePage class above in
                 the second parameter to the <literal>createDomNode</literal>

			Returning an HTML page isn't always the best way for the user to

			Tapestry is a powerful, component-oriented web application
			framework from Apache's Jakarta project (<ulink
			url="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry"/>). Spring Framework is a
			powerful J2EE application framework which is built around the
			concept of a lightweight container. While Spring has its own
			powerful web ui layer, there are a number of unique advantages to
			building a J2EE application using a combination of Tapestry for
			the web ui, and the Spring container for the lower layers. This
			document attempts to detail a few best practices for combining
			these two frameworks. It is expected that you are relatively
			familiar with both Tapestry and Spring Framework basics, so they
			will not be explained here. General introductory documentation for
			both Tapestry and Spring Framework are available on their

                 Inside the Tapestry application, we need to load this
                 application context, and allow Tapestry pages to get the
                 authenticationService and userService beans, which implement
                 the AuthenticationService and UserService interfaces,
                 respectively.

			</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="view-tapestry-appctx">
			<title>Obtaining beans in Tapestry pages</title>
			<para>

				At this point, the application context is available to a
				web-app by calling Spring's static utility function
				WebApplicationContextUtils.getApplicationContext(servletContext),
				where servletContext is the standard ServletContext from the
				J2EE Servlet spec. As such, one simple mechanism for a page to
				get an instance of the UserService, for example, would be with
				code such as:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
   WebApplicationContext appContext = WebApplicationContextUtils.getApplicationContext(
           getRequestCycle().getRequestContext().getServlet().getServletContext());
   UserService userService = appContext.getBean("userService");
   ... some code which uses UserService
]]></programlisting> 

                This mechanism does work. It can be made a lot less verbose by
                encapsulating most of the functionality in a method in the
                base class for the page or component. However, in some
                respects it goes against the Inversion of Control approach
                which Spring encourages, which is being used in other layers
                of this app, in that ideally you would like the page to not
                have to ask the context for a specific bean by name, and in
                fact, the page would ideally not know about the context at
                all.

			</para>

			<para>
 
                Luckilly, there is a mechanism to allow this. We rely upon the
                fact that Tapestry already has a mechanism to declaratively
                add properties to a page, and it is in fact the preferred
                approach to manage all properties on a page in this
                declarative fashion, so that Tapestry can properly maange
                their lifecycle as part of the page and component lifecycle.

			</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="view-tapestry-exposeappctx">
			<title>Exposing the application context to Tapestry</title>
			<para>
 
                First we need to make the Application Context available to the
                Tapestry page or Component without having to have the
                ServletContext; this is because at the stage in the
                page's/component's lifecycle when we need to access the
                Application Context, the ServletContext won't be easily
                available to the page, so we can't use
                WebApplicationContextUtils.getApplicationContext(servletContext)
                directly. One way is by defining a custom version of the
                Tapestry IEngine which exposes this for us:
 

<programlisting><![CDATA[
 package com.whatever.web.xportal;
 ...
 import ...
 ...
 public class MyEngine extends org.apache.tapestry.engine.BaseEngine {
 
   public static final String APPLICATION_CONTEXT_KEY = "appContext";
 
   /**
    * @see org.apache.tapestry.engine.AbstractEngine#setupForRequest(org.apache.tapestry.request.RequestContext)
    */
   protected void setupForRequest(RequestContext context) {
     super.setupForRequest(context);
     
     // insert ApplicationContext in global, if not there
     Map global = (Map) getGlobal();
     ApplicationContext ac = (ApplicationContext) global.get(APPLICATION_CONTEXT_KEY);
     if (ac == null) {
       ac = WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(
         context.getServlet().getServletContext()
       );
       global.put(APPLICATION_CONTEXT_KEY, ac);
     }
   }
 }
]]></programlisting> 
 
                This engine class places the Spring Application Context as an
                attribute called "appContext" in this Tapestry app's 'Global'
                object. Make sure to register the fact that this special
                IEngine instance should be used for this Tapestry application,
                with an entry in the Tapestry application definition file. For
                example:
 

<programlisting><![CDATA[

			</sect3>


			<sect3 id="view-tapestry-componentdefs">
			<title>Component definition files</title>
			<para>
                 Now in our page or component definition file (*.page or
                 *.jwc), we simply add property-specification elements to grab
                 the beans we need out of the ApplicationContext, and create
                 page or component properties for them. For example:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
   <property-specification name="userService"
                           type="com.whatever.services.service.user.UserService">

   </property-specification>
   <property-specification name="authenticationService"

     global.appContext.getBean("authenticationService")
   </property-specification>
]]></programlisting> 
 
                 The OGNL expression inside the property-specification
                 specifies the initial value for the property, as a bean
                 obtained from the context. The entire page definition might
                 look like this:

				<para> 
                Now in the Java class definition for the page or component
                itself, all we need to do is add an abstract getter method for
                the properties we have defined, to access them. When the page
                or component is actually loaded by Tapestry, it performs
                runtime code instrumentation on the classfile to add the
                properties which have been defined, and hook up the abstract
                getter methods to the newly created fields. For example:
 

<programlisting><![CDATA[

                In this example, we've managed to allow service beans defined
                in the Spring Application Context to be provided to the page
                in a declarative fashion. The page class does not know where
                the service implementations are coming from, and in fact it is
                easy to slip in another implementation, for example, during
                testing. This inversion of control is one of the prime goals
                and benefits of the Spring Framework, and we have managed to
                extend it all the way up the J2EE stack in this Tapestry
                application.
