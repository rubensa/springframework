KNOWN ISSUES
============

Spring Framework 2.0 M1
-----------------------

Package org.springframework.aop
* argument binding in AspectJ expression pointcuts is not fully functional
* AspectJ-style introductions are not supported: all code is experimental and incomplete
* Aspect precedence is not implemented yet

Package org.springframework.beans
* using a BeanDefinitionDecorator that switches the TargetSource will generate class proxies too eagerly
