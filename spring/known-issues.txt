KNOWN ISSUES
============

Spring Framework 2.0 M1
-----------------------

Package org.springframework.aop
* Argument binding in AspectJ expression pointcuts is not fully functional
* AspectJ-style introductions is not supported - all code is experimental and incomplete
* Aspect precedence is not implemented

Package org.springframework.beans
* Using a BeanDefinitionDecorator that switches the TargetSource will generate class proxies too eagerly. This behaviour will be fixed in M2.
