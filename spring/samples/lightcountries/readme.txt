-- Spring Light Countries demo --
@author Jean-Pierre Pawlak

This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "ant" in this directory for available targets
(e.g. "ant build", "ant warfile"). Note that to start
Ant this way, you'll need an XML parser in your
classpath (e.g. jre/lib/ext; included in JDK 1.4).
You can also invoke Ant manually, in this directory.
For windows systems, you can alternatively use warfile.bat
instead of "ant warfile".

Your warfile will be cretad in the 'dist' directory.

This will normally run as is in most application servers.


And then ?
----------
It rest to look at the sources and configuration to study and understand what you
made and how. 
The focus is on the web part of the framework. Nevertheless, the
current demo doesn't show the user input nor the validation process.
