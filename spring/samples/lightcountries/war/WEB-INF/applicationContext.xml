<!--
  - Root application context definition for a web app that uses JDBC.
  -
  - Does not depend on web infrastructure or any web-specific classes!
  - Assumes running in a J2EE environment in the "dataSource" definition, as
  - it looks for a "java:comp/env/jdbc/myds" JNDI DataSource, but that can be
  - replaced easily (as noted). Such a context definition can thus be reused
  - in test environments or standalone applications without any hassle.
  -
  - We put the "application" beans in this file. Only beans needed for the application will stay
  - here and avoid any Web related bean which will be configured in their servlet configuration 
  - (ie countries-servlet.xml).
  - We start with the DATA layer. After comes the BUSINESS layer (non existent for this tiny application).
  - As explained above, the INTERFACE or CLIENT levels will be done in countries-servlet.xml.   
  -
  - If an application is only developped for web environnement, it may be possible to define here
  - some general web beans reused in different servlets.

	<!-- ========================= GENERAL DEFINITIONS ========================= -->

	<!--
	  - The message source for this context, loaded from localized "messages_xx" files
	  - in the classpath, i.e. "/WEB-INF/classes/messages.properties" or
	  - "/WEB-INF/classes/messages_fr.properties".
	  -
	  - "getMessage" calls to this context will use this source.
	  - Child contexts can have their own message sources, inheriting all messages from this
	  - source, being able to define new messages and override ones defined in this source.
	  -
	  - We have no need for application messages in this tiny application, so this definition
	  - will simply be used by the next level (web - - lcountries-servlet.xml).
