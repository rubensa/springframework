of the sample you wish to run.

2. cd to the root directory of the sample you wish to run.

3. tweak the copied 'build.properties' to your environment

4. tweak 'build.bat' to point your environemnt so the ant build system can execute.

5. run 'build dist' to build the application .war file, ready for deployment.

6. if tomcat is installed on your system, run 'build tomcat.server.start' to start it and deploy the
sample application in one step.
