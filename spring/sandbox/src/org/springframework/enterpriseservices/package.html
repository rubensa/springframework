This package provides declarative metadata services inspired
by .NET.

<br>
To use this feature,
<ul>
<li>Define metadata attributes such as transaction attributes
on your beans
<li>Include an EnterpriseServices bean definition in your
application context
<li>Include MetadataDrivenPointcuts in your
application context that understand your metadata attributes
</ul>

In practice, the second and third steps can be achieved by simply
importing existing generic enterprise services XML bean definitions.

<br>
Unlike the present .NET mechanism, this mechanism is extensible.
You can define any metadat attributes you want, and any
MetadataDrivenPointcuts that understand them, and
the EnterpriseServices bean postprocessor will automatically
create AOP proxies around them.
