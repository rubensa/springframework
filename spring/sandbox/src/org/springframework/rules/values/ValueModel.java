 * A container for a value that can change. This container encapsulates /
 * abstracts away the logic necessary to access, set, and be notified of changes
 * in the contained value.
 * 
 * The value model pattern greatly simplifies client(s) access to a mutable
 * value, as clients access the value in a consistent manner (through this
 * common interface). Clients may also use this interface to subscribe for value
 * change events.
 * 
 * A good example of the ValueModel pattern is the ThreadLocal object. Another
 * example is a mediator between GUI controls and the domain model.
