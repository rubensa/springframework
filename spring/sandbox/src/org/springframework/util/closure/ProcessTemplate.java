/**
 * A interface to be implemented by objects which encapsulate a workflow process
 * template. For example, a template process might produce elements from a data
 * source for processing.
 * <p>
 * Process templates encapsulate the work and logic common to a specific
 * workflow. A user-provided closure call back is passed in on process execution
 * and is called to insert custom processing within the template.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following code snippet demonstrates a generator that
 * produces parsed csv records from an underlying file resource. In this case,
 * this <code>recordGenerator</code> encapsulates required resource management
 * (opening/closing resources) and the algorithm to parse / iterate over
 * records. The results (a single parsed record) are passed to the callback for
 * processing.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ProcessTemplate recordGenerator = new CsvRecordGenerator(new FileSystemResource(file));
 * recordGenerator.run(new Block() {
 * 	protected void handle(Object csvRecord) {
 * 		// process each record
 * 	}
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This is a generic equivalent to approaches used throughout The Spring
 * Framework, including Spring's JDBC Template for processing DB query result
 * sets. In addition to providing a common callback interface, it is intended
 * for convenience in situations where defining a separate callback hierarchy to
 * support a template callback approach is overkill.
