 * Handles flow events signaled by the web-tier in response to web-controller
 * requests. There are two major different types of event processing operations:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>1. A start operation, requesting the creation of a new session for the
 * Flow definition associated with this processor. A start operation transitions
 * the new flow session to its starting state.
 * <li>2. An event execution operation, signaling the occurence of a event in
 * the current state of an existing flow, submitting it for processing.
 * Processing the event occurence causes the current state of the flow to
 * transition to a new state.
 * 
 * This interface is everything web-tier controllers need to inteface with the
 * web flow system. This is their entry point.
