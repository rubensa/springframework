/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between
 * portlet requests and controller objects.
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers, although this
 * is not necessary, as PortletModeControllerMapping
 * is included in the framework.
 *
 * <p>PortletControllerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do
 * not have to. A controller will always be wrapped in a PortletControllerExecutionChain
 * instance, optionally accompanied by some PortletControllerInterceptor instances.
 * The DispatcherPortlet will first call each PortletControllerInterceptor's preController
 * method in the given order, finally invoking the controller itself if all
 * preController methods have returned "true".
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able
 * to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by
 * DispatcherPortlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
