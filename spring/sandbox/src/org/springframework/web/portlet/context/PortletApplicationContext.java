/** 
 * Interface to provide configuration for a portlet application. This is read-only while
 * the application is running, but may be reloaded if the implementation supports this.
 *
 * <p>This interface adds a getPortletContext method to the WebApplicationContext
 * interface.  Portlet applications leverage WebApplicationContext which defines a 
 * well-known application attribute name that the root context must be bound to in
 * the bootstrap process.
 *
 * <p>Like generic application contexts, portlet application contexts are hierarchical.
 * There is a single root context per application, while each portlet in the application
 * (including a dispatcher portlet in the MVC framework) has its own child context.
 *
 * <p>In addition to standard application context lifecycle capabilities,
 * PortletApplicationContext implementations need to detect PortletContextAware
 * beans and invoke the setPortletContext method accordingly.
