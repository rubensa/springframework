/**
 * TODO update this
 * Base PortletController interface, representing a component that receives RenderRequest
 * and RenderResponse like a <code>Portlet</code> but is able to participate in
 * an MVC workflow. Comparable to the notion of a Struts <code>Action</code>
 *
 * <p>Any implementation of the PortletController interface should be a
 * <i>reusable, threadsafe</i> class, capable of handling multiple
 * portlet requests throughout the lifecycle of an application. To be able to
 * configure PortletController in an easy way, Controllers are usually JavaBeans.</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="workflow">Workflow</a>:</b><br>
 * After the DispatcherPortlet has received a request and has done its work
 * to resolve themes and things a like, it tries to resolve
 * a PortletController, using a {@link org.springframework.web.portlet.HandlerMapping
 * HandlerMapping}. When a PortletController has been found, the \
 * {@link #handleRequest(RenderRequest, RenderResponse) handleRequest()}
 * method will be invoked, which is responsible for handling the actual
 * request and - if applicable - returning an appropriate ModelAndView.
 * So actually, this method is the main entrypoint for the
 * {@link org.springframework.web.portlet.DispatcherPortlet DispatcherPortlet}
 * which delegates requests to controllers. This method - and also this interface -
 * should preferrably not be implemented by custom controllers <i>directly</i>, since
 * abstract controller also provided by this package already provide a lot
 * of functionality common for virtually all portlet applications. A few examples of
 * those abstract controllers:
 * {@link AbstractController AbstractController},
 * {@link AbstractCommandController AbstractCommandController} and
 * {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}.
 * </p>
 * <p>So basically any <i>direct</i> implementation of the PortletController interface
 * just handles RenderRequests and should return a ModelAndView, to be
 * further used by the DispatcherPortlet. Any additional functionality such
 * as optional validation, formhandling, etcetera should be obtained by
 * extended one of the abstract controller mentioned above.
 * </p>
