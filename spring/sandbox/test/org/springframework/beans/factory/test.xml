	<description>
		Generic autoproxy definitions enabling declarative transaction management,
		based on Commons Attributes attributes. The application context must define
		a single PlatformTransactionManager for autoproxying to work.

		This file is generic, and not specific to JPetStore. You can use it unchanged
		as an application context definition file for your own applications to get
		attribute-driven declarative transaction management.

		The power of this approach is more apparent when you have many transactional
		business objects, not just one as in this simple application.

		Add more Advisor definitions if you want, for additional declarative services.

	<!--
		This bean is a postprocessor that will automatically apply relevant advisors
		to any bean in child factories.
