	 * view state is entered or an end state is entered and the flow terminates.
	 * Action states are executed without returning control, as their result
	 * always triggers another state transition, executed interally. Action
	 * states can also be executed in a chain like fashion (e.g action state 1
	 * (result), action state 2 (result), action state 3 (result), view state
	 * <control returns so view can be rendered>).
	 * <p>
	 * If you wish to verify expected behaivior on each state transition (and
	 * not just when the view state triggers return of control back to the
	 * client), you have a few options:
	 * <p>
	 * First, you can always write a standalone unit test for the
	 * <code>Action</code> implementation. There you can verify that the
	 * action executes its core logic and responds to any exceptions it must
	 * handle. When you do this, you may mock or stub out services the Action
	 * implementation needs that are expensive to initialize. You can also
	 * verify there that the action put everything in the model or the request
	 * it was supposed to (to meet its contract with the view it is prepping for
	 * display, if itâ€™s a view setup action).
	 * <p>
	 * Second, you can attach a FlowExecutionListener to the ongoing flow
	 * execution at any time within your test code, which receives callbacks on
	 * each state transition (among at other points). To add a listener, call
	 * <code>getFlowExecution().getListenerList().add(myListener)</code>,
	 * where myListener is a class that implements the FlowExecutionListener
	 * interface (It is recommended you extend FlowExecutionListenerAdapter and
	 * only override what you need.
