Bean post processors for use in ApplicationContexts to simplify AOP usage
by automatically creating AOP proxies without the need to use a ProxyFactoryBean.
<br>
The various post processors in this package need only be added to an ApplicationContext--
typically in an XML bean definition document--to automatically proxy selected beans.
Please note carefully the Javadocs on the auto proxy creator implementations, as
some naming conventions should be observed for objects referenced by the 
auto proxy creators to avoid the risk of circular references, when an auto proxy creator
attempts to proxy a class it depends on.
