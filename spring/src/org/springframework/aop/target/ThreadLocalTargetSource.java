/**
 * Alternative to an object pool. This invoker uses a threading model in which
 * every thread has its own copy of the target. There's no contention for targets.
 * Target object creation is kept to a minimum on the running server.
 *
 * <p>Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume they
 * will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different threads.
 * However, state can be relied on during the operations of a single thread.
 *
 * <p>Cleanup is performed in the destroy() method from DisposableBean.
 * We can't get at the ThreadLocals there, but we can use a layer of indirection
 * to clear the references they hold.
 *
 * <p><b>This pooling model should be considered alpha. It has not yet been
 * tested in production.</b>
