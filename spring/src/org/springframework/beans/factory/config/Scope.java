 * <p><code>Scope</code> implementations are expected to be thread-safe.
 * One <code>Scope</code> can be used with multiple bean factories, if desired.
 *
 * <p>An example of a possible underlying storage mechansim would be a session
 * API such as the Servlet API's {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession} interface.
