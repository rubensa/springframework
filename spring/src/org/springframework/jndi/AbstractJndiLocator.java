/**
 * Convenient superclass for JNDI-based service locators. Subclasses are
 * JavaBeans, exposing a jndiName property. This may or may not include
 * the "java:comp/env/" prefix expected by J2EE applications when accessing
 * a locally mapped (ENC - Environmental Naming Context) resource. If it
 * doesn't, the "java:comp/env/" prefix will be prepended if the "resourceRef"
 * property is true (the default is <strong>false</strong>) and no other scheme
 * like "java:" is given.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses must implement the located() method to cache the results
 * of the JNDI lookup. They don't need to worry about error handling.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Assumptions:</b> The resource obtained from JNDI can be cached.
 * 
 * <p>Subclasses will often be used as singletons in a bean container. This
 * sometimes presents a problem if that bean container pre-instantiates singletons,
 * since this class does the JNDI lookup in its init method, but the resource being
 * pointed to may not exist at that time, even though it may exist at the time of
 * first usage. The solution is to tell the bean container not to pre-instantiate
 * this class (i.e. lazily initialize it instead).<p>
