/** 
 * Interface to provide configuration for a web application. This is read-only while
 * the application is running, but may be reloaded if the implementation supports this.
 *
 * <p>This interface adds ServletContext methods to the generic ApplicationContext
 * interface, and defines a well-known application attribute name that the root
 * context must be bound to in the bootstrap process.
 *
 * <p>In addition to standard application context lifecycle capabilities,
 * WebApplicationContext implementations need to detect ServletContextAware
 * beans and invoke the setServletContext accordingly.
 *
 * <p>Like generic application contexts, web application contexts are hierarchical.
 * There is a single root context per application, while each servlet in the application
 * (including a dispatcher servlet in the MVC framework) has its own child context.
