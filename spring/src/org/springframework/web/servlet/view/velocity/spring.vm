 * spring.vm
 *
 * This file consists of a collection of Velocity macros aimed at easing
 * some of the common requirements of web applications - in particular 
 * handling of forms.
 *
 * Spring's Velocity support will automatically make this file and therefore
 * all macros within it available to any application using Spring's 
 * VelocityConfigurer.
 *
 * To take advantage of these macros, the "exposeSpringMacroHelpers" property
 * of the VelocityView class needs to be set to "true". This will expose a
 * RequestContext under the name "springMacroRequestContext", as needed by
 * the macros in this library.

 * springBind
 * 
 * Exposes a BindStatus object for the given bind path, which can be
 * a bean (e.g. "person") to get global errors, or a bean property
 * (e.g. "person.name") to get field errors. Can be called multiple times
 * within a form to bind to multiple command objects and/or field names.
 *
 * This macro will participate in the default HTML escape setting for the given
 * RequestContext. This can be customized by calling "setDefaultHtmlEscape"
 * on the "springMacroRequestContext" context variable, or via the
 * "defaultHtmlEscape" context-param in web.xml (same as for the JSP bind tag).
 *
 * Producing no output, the following context variable will be available
 * each time this macro is referenced:
 *
 *   $status : a BindStatus instance holding the command object name,
 *   expression, value, and error codes and messages for the path supplied
 *
 * @param $path : the path (string value) of the value required to bind to.
 *   Spring defaults to a command name of "command" but this can be overridden
 *   by user config.
 *#
#macro( springBind $path )
	#set ($status = $springMacroRequestContext.getBindStatus($path))
#end

#**
 * springBindEscaped
 *
 * Similar to springBind, but takes an explicit HTML escape flag rather
 * than relying on the default HTML escape setting.
 *#
#macro( springBindEscaped $path $escape)
	#set ($status = $springMacroRequestContext.getBindStatus($path, $escape))
#end
