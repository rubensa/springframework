 * spring.vm
 *
 * This file consists of a collection of Velocity macros aimed at easing
 * some of the common requirements of web applications - in particular 
 * handling of forms.
 *
 * Spring's Velocity support will automatically make this file and therefore
 * all macros within it available to any application using Spring's 
 * VelocityConfigurer.
 *
 * To take advantage of these macros, a template must be rendered by using
 * Spring's VelocityFormView class (a simple extension of the normal
 * VelocityView) which sets up the render tool used by these macros.

 * springBind
 * 
 * sets some well-known context attributes up to correspond to errors
 * and field values based on the parameters received.  Can be called 
 * multiple times within a form to bind to new command objects and or
 * field names.
 *
 * Producing no output, the following context variables will be available
 * each time this macro is referenced:
 *
 *  $status : a BindStatus instance holding the command object name,
 *  expression, value and error messages and codes for the path supplied
 *
 * @param $path : the path (string value) of the value required to bind to.  Spring
 *   defaults to a command name of "command" but this can be overridden by user 
 *   config.
 *
 * @param $escape : should output be HTML escaped (true/false)
 *#
#macro( springBind $path $escape )
	#set ($status = $springBindStatusHelper.createBindStatus($path, $escape))
#end
