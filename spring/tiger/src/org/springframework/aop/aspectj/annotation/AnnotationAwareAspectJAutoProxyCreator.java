/**
 * AspectJAwareAdvisorAutoProxyCreator subclass that processes all AspectJ
 * annotation classes in the current application context, as well as Spring Advisors.
 *
 * <p>Any AspectJ annotated classes will automatically be recognized, and their advice
 * applied if Spring AOP's proxy-based model is capable of applying it.
 * This covers method execution joinpoints.
 *
 * <p>If the &lt;aop:include&gt; element is used, only @AspectJ beans with names matched by
 * an include pattern will be considered as defining aspects to use for Spring autoproxying.
 *
 * <p>Processing of Spring Advisors follows the rules established in
 * {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator}.
