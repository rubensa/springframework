Classes enabling AspectJ 5 @Annotated classes to be automatically picked up and weaved by Spring AOP.

<p>Simply include in an application context AspectJ 5 annotation-style syntax classes and they will
automatically be weaved using Spring AOP. This enables DI to be applies to AspectJ aspects.

<p>Semantics will be consistent with the subset of AspectJ supported (method execution joinpoints).

<p>As the AspectJAutoProxyCreator is a subclass of DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator,
the processing of Spring AOP advisors will occur as normal, and AspectJAutoProxyCreator can be
considered as an alternative for AspectJAutoProxyCreator that amounts to a drop-in replacement.
Spring AOP advisors will be processed before AspectJ aspects.
