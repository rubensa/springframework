Simplification layer over JdbcTemplate available on Java 5 and above.
	<br>
	</br>
	
JdbcTemplateHelper is a wrapper around JdbcTemplate that takes advantage
	of var args and autoboxing. It also offers only a subset of the methods
	available on JdbcTemplate--hence it does not implement the JdbcOperations
	interface or extend JdbcTemplate, but implements the new
	SimpleJdbcOperations interface.
	<p>
		If you need the full power of Spring JDBC for less common operations,
		use the getJdbcTemplate() method of JdbcTemplateHelper and work
		with it directly.
